 75%
 It's like the
 P pass right here
 Have any
 Questions about that?
 Alright, if no questions I want to move on
 Do you have any questions?
 No
 You want to get the higher grade?
 Sure, right?
 Yeah, you explain
 Because he was out
 Oh, okay
 Alright, if no questions
 I want to move on
 We'll still
 Start the logistic regression model, alright?
 You know?
 Alright, today
 I'm going to show you how to
 Include a calicoid
 Protector into
 Logistic regression model
 Now, I'm going to put the hand out
 It's only one in the network, right?
 Now, the hand out has been closed on right side
 It's number 6
 Under regression
 Logistic regression model
 Including calicoid protector into regression model
 Now, the hand out
 On right side
 Including calicoid protector into regression model
 It's number 6
 Under logistic regression model
 Right in here
 That's it, that's one
 Okay
 Got a copy?
 Okay
 We're going to move on
 Alright, um
 I should not take this
 The data set of these data, okay?
 One thing about data set
 It's called
 Oh, data science class
 Alright, the data set
 Called data science
 The data set
 Called data science
 Contains information of student
 Embroidered in
 An introductory
 Introductory data science
 Course
 The objective is to model
 The probability that a student
 Passed the course
 Using the logistic regression
 Model
 The data set includes
 Three variables
 First is the numerical predictor
 The number of hours a student
 Passed the course
 The probability per week
 Second, a calicoid protector
 Called code experience
 Okay
 This variable
 Consists of three categories
 One, intermediate
 And proficiency
 And the last one is called
 Pass
 It's also a calicoid variable
 Okay, this variable
 Takes on two numbers
 Zero
 One means student
 Passed the course
 Zero means student
 Failed the course
 Now, the full data set
 Can be downloaded from this link
 They copy the link
 Right in the data set
 That's the data set, right?
 So the data set consists of
 Three columns
 Alright, first
 The first column
 The second column
 The third column
 The fourth column
 The fifth column
 The sixth column
 The seventh column
 Alright, first
 The first column contains
 The number of hours a student spent studying
 Right?
 Second column is the level of
 Code experience
 The last one is
 When a student passed the course or not
 Makes sense to you?
 Alright
 We're going to use the data set later
 But let me
 Look at the question first
 Alright, we call
 The objective of using the data
 Is to
 Model, is to predict
 The probability of a student
 Passing the course
 Is that right?
 Based on some predictor
 The two, right?
 First, the number of hours
 A student spent studying, right?
 Second
 Is the coding experience
 Remember it's data science class, right?
 You need to code, right?
 So if you have some experience in coding
 Would that help to increase the chance
 Of passing the course?
 Sounds good?
 Alright
 So how to
 Set the model
 How to set up the logistic regression model
 Alright
 So let me write down something first
 Let's see
 This is all a marker, right?
 Alright
 So the logistic regression model
 Is this
 The model
 The model is
 First part of the log
 Log fourth, right?
 Okay
 Of passing
 Is defined as
 Long of P over 1 as P
 Is that right?
 This is the first part, right?
 Equals to
 Our linear function
 Of some predictor, right?
 The linear function
 Of a predictor
 The question is
 Now
 If all the predictors are in red, right?
 If all the predictors are in blue, right?
 It's just A plus B, right?
 That's simple
 However
 If one of the predictors is not in red
 It's categorical
 How can you handle it?
 In this case, we do have a categorical predictor
 Which is
 Coding experience
 It does not take a number
 It takes on category
 It takes on label, is that right?
 Alright
 Let's connect
 This categorical predictor
 Into
 The linear function
 I hope you learned that from the previous class, right?
 Let's do the review
 To include a categorical
 Variable or predictor
 In our regression model
 We must convert the categorical
 Variable or predictor
 Into
 W variable also called
 Indicator variable
 I'm not sure what language you used before, right?
 I usually call W variable
 W, okay?
 Now a W variable
 Is a variable that takes on two
 Possible value, either one or zero
 That's it, one or zero
 No any other value
 Now we use one
 To indicate the present
 Of a specific category
 And zero to indicate
 The absent
 Of that category
 I'm going to show you an example, okay?
 If a categorical variable
 Has k categories
 We only need k
 Minus one dummy variable
 Now for example
 If a categorical variable
 Has three categories
 We only need two dummy
 Variables
 So what's up there?
 Okay
 In this case
 We have one categorical predictor
 Is coding experience
 Okay?
 Coding experience has three levels
 Has three categories
 One, mean nothing
 No experience
 Second, intermediate
 Middle level, right?
 The third one, proficiency
 Expert
 Okay? Very experienced
 Now let's define the two dummy
 Variables
 As I said, right?
 If a categorical variable has three categories
 We only need two
 Dummy variables
 Is a query log
 Alright? So let's define
 The two dummy variables
 Here's the two
 First, coding one
 Okay?
 Now this is all label, right?
 As a dummy variable
 This variable takes on two values
 One or zero
 Coding one
 Is one if a student
 Has no coding experience
 Zero
 If otherwise
 Alright, the other one is coding proficiency
 Okay? Coding proficiency is
 One if a student
 Has proficiency
 Coding
 Experience
 Zero if otherwise
 So that's all good?
 Alright, now I'm going to show you
 How to use two dummy
 Variables to represent
 Three categories
 Alright, let me show you how to
 Use the two dummy variables to represent
 Three categories
 Now, if a student has no coding
 Experience
 Then
 Coding none
 Will be one, is that right?
 And coding proficiency will be zero
 Does that make sense to you?
 Alright, now if a student
 Has proficiency
 Coding experience
 Now proficiency, right?
 Coding none will be one
 Coding none will be one
 Should be
 Zero, is that right?
 And coding proficiency
 Will be
 One, is that right?
 So that's all good?
 Alright, the last one
 If a student has intermediate
 Coding experience
 Then coding none
 Should be one
 Should be
 Should be what?
 Zero
 Zero, right?
 What about coding proficiency?
 Zero
 Zero, right, good?
 Not none, not proficiency
 Will be zero, right?
 That's the way how to represent
 Three categories with two dummy, right?
 Alright, now the category
 Represented by both
 W variables being equal to zero
 Is called the
 Reference category
 I will explain the reference category later
 In more detail
 In this case, right, the category
 Intermediate
 Represented by both
 W variables being zero
 Therefore, the reference category
 For coding experience
 Is intermediate
 Right?
 Now remember
 The reference category
 We will use it later, alright?
 Alright, now let's formulate
 The logistic regression model
 Using
 The dummy variables defined above
 First
 We define P
 P as the probability
 That our student will pass the course
 An hour
 Now use hour, right?
 Instead of x
 Being the number of hours a student
 Studied per week
 So the logistic regression model is
 Revlog, right?
 Of P
 Over
 What minus P?
 Okay?
 Equal
 To the linear function
 Of all the predictors, right?
 So we get
 Interest at A
 Plus the
 Proficient
 B for hour
 Times
 The hour
 Alright, and plus
 The term
 For coding experience
 Remember, we have been
 Confirmed coding experience to
 Two dummy variables, right?
 We got the two terms
 The coefficient
 For coding
 Experience, none
 I put it down, right?
 Times coding
 None
 Class
 The coefficient
 For proficiency
 Any questions so far?
 Now, on the left side, right?
 We have the
 Log-orcs
 Log-orcs
 Okay?
 Of passing the course
 Okay?
 Okay, log-orcs
 Of passing the course
 On the right side, you have the linear
 Function of all the predictors
 Does that make sense to you?
 So what's good?
 That is the model
 We need to
 Relate the probability
 With a set of predictors
 Does that make sense to you?
 Everybody's okay?
 Everybody's okay?
 We're going to fit the model to the data
 Are you ready?
 Alright, let me open R, right?
 Okay
 Great, so let me copy the line
 The archives of data sets
 Look at the recommended data sets
 Like here
 All right, and save it into file address, that's the article file, right?
 We need that to get the data, certainly not.
 Then we're going to use read.csv function.
 This function takes the article file, and then read the data from the file and load it into R.
 So let me say that they can do an object called myData.
 All right, so when you type myData, you see a data, right?
 All right, I'm going to give you a gradient, by the way, or should I write, please, one more time?
 To load the data.
 You need one more time?
 Ready?
 Okay.
 Ready?
 Are you ready yet?
 All right, everybody ready?
 Should I move on?
 All right, now once the data has been loaded into R, we have to get the name of all variables, right?
 Let's do the name function to get the names of all variables.
 Write those in the name of variable.
 All right, so let's get all the predictor, right?
 Okay, now let's get all the dummy variables first, right?
 So let's get the dummy variable.
 Now to do that, we have to use a function called inL, right?
 We define two dummy variables, right?
 First, it's called codingNone.
 Let's just say no coding experience.
 Now, codingNone is one if a student has no experience.
 Otherwise, zero.
 So we can use the inL function to do that.
 So equal to inL, inL, right?
 Now, first we need to look at the coding experience, right?
 Now, coding experience comes from my data, right?
 So my data, dollar, coding experience, equal, equal, for double code.
 Now, let me double check coding experience, okay?
 I want to do something before I move on, okay?
 I want to see what are the categories, and make sure the spelling.
 I want to know the name, how is the name of the category.
 It's actually not.
 So let me get my data, dollar, code experience.
 All right, I want to use table function to double check the table function, right?
 Now, I just want to know the name of all categories.
 Let me fix that to you.
 I want to make a table to summarize coding experience.
 From here, I will know all the names, right?
 The name, all the levels of coding experience.
 All right, these are the three levels, right?
 In the media, none and efficiency.
 Now, I want to check it, right?
 All the names, they give an uppercase letter.
 You can see that, okay?
 If you take a lowercase, you won't get anything.
 It makes sense to you.
 That's why I want to look at this variable, right?
 So let me call in the name.
 We'll get used to it later.
 I don't want the name, right?
 So if the coding experience is none, then I put a comma and then put one.
 It means if the coding experience is none, then coding none will be one and zero,
 if otherwise, right?
 Then put a comma and zero.
 Basically said, if coding experience is none,
 we're going to return one and save it into coding none,
 otherwise, zero, we're going to return zero, right?
 And save it into these objects, these variables.
 That make sense to you?
 So let's do one more.
 The other one is coding proficiency.
 Coding proficiency, right?
 If coding experience is proficiency,
 let me call in the name here, right?
 Proficiency.
 Then coding proficiency is one and zero, if otherwise.
 Do you follow me?
 Sounds good?
 All right.
 Now we have the two W variables, right?
 Let's get the hour found for the data, right?
 Let's call hour.
 Hour equal to my data, dollar, study, hours for me.
 This is the name, right?
 I want to save it into hour, right?
 So now we've got all the predictors, right?
 All right, one more thing.
 We have to get the response variable, right?
 Get the response variable.
 Let's say pass, right?
 Okay, pass equal to my data, dollar, pass, okay?
 Now this will return one and zero, right?
 But that's not enough.
 Why?
 This is just a list that contains two numbers, right?
 One and zero.
 But it's not a calico variable, right?
 So how do you convert a calico variable to a calico variable?
 We need a factor function, right?
 So please do this step, a factor, right?
 A high factor function on pass.
 Factor on pass, right?
 Does that make sense to you?
 So far so good?
 All right, let me execute.
 All right, let me execute the commands.
 That's fine to me, right?
 I don't have any error message.
 Let's double check.
 Coding, none.
 Open one and zero, right?
 Coding, proficiency, should be capital letter, right?
 Is that right?
 Yeah, capital letter, okay.
 And hour?
 All right, that's pretty good to me.
 I don't see any problem, right?
 Did you?
 Now we're going to fit the model.
 We're going to fit the logistic regression model.
 Okay.
 Are you ready?
 Okay, to fit the model, we use the glm function, right?
 So glm, the word of response is pass, right?
 You want to model the policy of pass, right?
 Q dot, okay, and tonight hour plus the 2W, right?
 Our coding, none, plus coding proficiency, right?
 Okay, and we're best at family, right?
 To model binary data, we need binomial, right?
 So family is binomial.
 So we're starting to fit the model.
 So far so good?
 Let's do a little bit of an extra queue.
 Click command.
 Then we're going to use summary function.
 All right, you get more detail of the result.
 Here we go.
 Now let's take a look, my result and with yours, right,
 do you get the same thing?
 For example, right?
 Look at the coefficient table.
 The first number is negative 2.98.
 Second number?
 Look at second number.
 Hour is 0.16742.
 So far so good.
 You need more time to get the output?
 Everything's okay?
 Everything's okay?
 Everything is okay?
 And yeah, one summary function here?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see it.
 Any question?
 Any idea?
 Everything's good?
 Everything's good?
 No problem, we're gonna move on.
 All right, let's go break, right?
 It's five, 11.
 Okay, let's go break first.
 Make sure.
 Okay, don't worry, be happy.
 So, it's the right time for a break, right?
 All right.
 All right.
 Okay.
 One, two, one, two, one, two.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 All right, are you ready?
 Hi, ready?
 Ready? Okay.
 Alright, next question.
 Alright, which one? Okay.
 I think C, right?
 Now we did fit the regression model, right?
 And obtained the regression output, right?
 Next, we're going to determine if coding experience
 is our significant predictor of the probability
 of a student passing the course.
 Alright, how do we know coding experience
 is a significant predictor?
 If it is related to the probability, right?
 Now, in the model, right?
 The two terms relate to the code experience, right?
 Here, these two terms, right?
 Now, if coding experience is not related to the probability, right?
 Okay, the term associated with coding experience
 should be gone, is that right?
 Does that make sense to you?
 So that means the coefficient,
 the regression coefficient associated
 for the coding experience should be zero.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Right, it's not related, right?
 If it's related, it's not zero.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Alright, let me just formalize the hypothesis.
 Okay.
 So, let's say you don't have all of the firsts.
 Okay, let's say you don't have all of the firsts.
 Okay, the code experience is a significant predictor
 of the probability of a student passing the course.
 Alright, what about the null hypothesis?
 Remember, the null hypothesis begins with O, right?
 O? No. Oh no!
 That means the code experience is not or has no relationship
 with our significant predictor.
 Predictor of a probability, right? Okay.
 Now, under the null hypothesis,
 this implies the regression coefficient
 associated with code experience is zero.
 Which one?
 The coefficient for null
 and the coefficient for
 the coefficient of both zero.
 Does that make sense to you?
 So, therefore, the model only works with two terms.
 The model works with each step in the hour, is that right?
 So, the logistic model?
 Only contains two terms.
 It's the interstep
 plus the hour.
 Is that right?
 Now, under the alternative hypothesis,
 that coding experience is a significant predictor of a probability, right?
 That means the coefficient associated with coding experience
 should not be zero.
 Is that right?
 Does not equal to zero?
 That means
 either one of the coefficients should not be zero.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Right, there are two coefficients, right?
 Either one of them should not be zero.
 One of them must not be zero, is that right?
 Does that make sense to you?
 Alright, now we need to run the test, right?
 To test the claim.
 To test the claim,
 we have to assume the null hypothesis is true, right?
 In the next second, we have to find evidence against the null hypothesis.
 The amount of evidence against the null hypothesis is given by p-value.
 Smaller p-value, stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, right?
 To get a p-value from theta,
 what is that thing called? Test statistic, right?
 How to get a test statistic p-value?
 We have to go from the likelihood ratio test.
 So let's perform a test.
 So to perform
 the test, the likelihood
 ratio test,
 ratio test,
 we need to calculate
 the likelihood ratio.
 It's the likelihood
 ratio.
 Okay, under the null hypothesis,
 divide by the maximum likelihood
 under H-A,
 right?
 Then we convert
 the likelihood ratio
 R
 to
 our chi-square statistic.
 Call D, right?
 P-value.
 Then
 get the p-value
 from the chi-square statistic.
 From the chi-square statistic, okay?
 Does that make sense to you?
 Are we okay with the procedure?
 Now, the chi-square statistic,
 call D for that, right?
 It's given by
 negative 2 times the long
 of the likelihood ratio.
 All right.
 Now we're going to carry
 the likelihood ratio test using R.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Now, to do that, right,
 we have to get the likelihood
 under the null hypothesis, right?
 We have to fit the model, right,
 under the null hypothesis
 and obtain the likelihood,
 right, and use it
 to compare the likelihood
 under the alternative.
 So what's so good?
 Are you ready?
 So what's so good? Are you ready to run?
 All right, so,
 so let me fit
 the logistic model
 with intercept
 and hour.
 So I'm going to say
 g of m
 has
 to the hour
 plus, that's it, that's all we need, right?
 Right? We need hour, that's it.
 That will include intercept.
 Then we need
 finally,
 is it finally over?
 We're out.
 We're only out, okay?
 Only hour.
 Okay, fit the model, only hour.
 Is it really not?
 No coding experience.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Right now, we're going to run
 Run the likelihood
 ratio
 test
 How to run it?
 We use another command
 a-n-o-v-a
 All right?
 This requires three
 inputs. First,
 as the model under null hypothesis.
 We need the model under null hypothesis, right?
 As infinite
 model, only hour.
 Okay?
 Second, we need fit the model
 with all predictor
 which is a
 fit the model, right?
 And the
 test option is a kind of
 square, right?
 That's all we need.
 Do you follow me?
 Do you follow me?
 Did you follow me?
 May I run the commands?
 Anyone need help?
 Is that okay?
 Hello?
 Capital C
 Capital C
 Capital C, okay?
 Here we go.
 All right.
 Now, couple of things.
 All right.
 Now, this is what we call
 divina, right?
 It's negative two times
 log of the likelihood ratio.
 Sound so good?
 All right? These two
 is the log
 likelihood, right? It's negative two times
 log likelihood.
 Sound so good?
 Remember, when you calculate log of
 the likelihood ratio, right?
 It's negative two terms.
 The log of likelihood
 under
 h0
 minus log
 likelihood
 under
 hj, right?
 The likelihood is the clear log.
 All right?
 We have the degree of freedom and the p-value.
 That's the p-value, right?
 What's the p-value?
 It's 1.544
 times e to the 7.
 That means it's a 7-0.
 7-0, right?
 Before
 1-5-0-4.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Smaller p-value,
 stronger evidence against
 the null hypothesis.
 In this case, it's a really small p-value, right?
 With a strong evidence against
 the null hypothesis.
 Can I move on?
 Can I move on?
 Can I say the p-value?
 1
 5
 4
 Okay.
 It's less than
 the significant level
 Let's say 0.25, right?
 The sample data
 of the leading general hypothesis first.
 We check
 the null hypothesis
 at 5%
 significant level.
 Sample data
 0.5
 sufficient evidence
 to conclude
 coding
 experience
 is our significant
 predictor
 of probability
 of passing
 the course.
 Okay.
 Does this make sense to you?
 All right. Next question.
 Now what do you find
 coding experience is
 significant predictor of probability, right?
 Let's move on
 to big prediction.
 Suppose a student
 studies for 10 hours
 in a week.
 Well, there's also time for 10 hours in a week, right?
 Okay.
 Predict the odds
 and probability of a student
 passing the course.
 Okay.
 Given a student with
 no coding experience
 with intermediate
 coding experience
 and proficiency coding
 experience. We're going to do
 one by one, okay? Are you ready?
 I may move on.
 Okay.
 How to predict
 that will start from log
 odds.
 The log odd, right,
 is given by
 the linear function of all predictor, right?
 A plus B
 for hour
 times the hour
 plus
 coefficient
 or
 none times
 the W variable
 coding
 none and plus the coefficient
 for proficiency
 times coding
 proficiency.
 So much for good.
 We've got a log odd, right?
 From the linear function of all predictor, right?
 When you've got the log odd, right,
 we can get the odd.
 How to get the odd?
 By e
 to log odd.
 Are you up here with that?
 Now, please remember our
 books relationship, right, you know?
 We're going to use that very frequently.
 Okay, when you first get a
 log odd,
 what can get the odd?
 How?
 By e
 to log odd.
 So much for good.
 Now, if you've got odds,
 we can get the probability.
 How?
 By taking odds
 over
 one plus odd.
 So much for good.
 If you want to jump to a log odd,
 to probability, right?
 We're going to
 do this transformation, right?
 e to the linear function
 of
 predictor
 defined by
 one plus e to the power of
 linear function
 of predictor.
 Is that clear or not?
 Alright? Now, I encourage you
 to remember this relationship,
 right?
 Now, don't worry about that, I'm going to
 show you the relationship, right?
 I will lay out the relationship. Is that clear or not?
 You don't need to memorize.
 It's going to be put on GC2, right?
 But if it's good, you can memorize.
 I want you to look at better form, right?
 Okay, so much for good.
 Now, I start with log odd.
 Get the odd
 and then get the probability.
 So much for good.
 Now, let me do an R.
 Don't make
 prediction.
 We start on first one.
 Okay?
 Student
 with no
 experience.
 Okay, none, right?
 Hour
 is 10, is that right?
 Okay. Now, let me
 set the value of x first.
 Option, right?
 Now, in this case, right, x,
 but in this case, right, the value of
 predictor, hour is 10.
 Is that right?
 Looks like new?
 Now, you have to student with
 no experience, right?
 Coding number will be 1.
 1 plus 1, right?
 Coding number will be 1.
 1 or 0?
 Coding number will be
 1.
 And coding proficiency will be
 0, right?
 Now, the intercept
 is a derivative
 of 8, okay?
 So, let me define
 the value
 of one predictor called x naught,
 right, equal to
 let me give you a list of functions,
 right, a list of number,
 right, and you see function
 to collect all the value
 of predictor, right?
 Now, we start with intercept.
 Now, intercept is a constant, right?
 You can think of
 8 times
 1, is that right?
 You can think of
 the value of the predictor
 is 1, so 1, right?
 1, 10, 1, and 0.
 So, let enter
 this into
 our list of a number, right?
 into our list.
 So, 1,
 10,
 1, and 0.
 Now, we can calculate
 the log arc, right?
 The log arc, right?
 Now, to get the log arc, we have to get
 all the coefficients, right?
 So, let me get
 the coefficients, right? You say coefficient function.
 C-O-E-F
 of the film model.
 We give you all the coefficients,
 right? And then time together,
 right? One time this, one
 time this number, 10
 time our, one time
 this number, zero time
 this number. Is that clear? And then add
 together.
 You follow?
 Let me show you, right?
 You follow?
 Okay.
 Okay, here is
 all the coefficients, right?
 This is the constant, right?
 You think of one time
 the constant, okay?
 That's all we need to input, right?
 Here, hour is 10, right?
 Alright,
 I need to take 10, multiply these numbers,
 okay? 10, multiply the
 coefficients for hour.
 Next time, coding 9, right?
 Coding 9 is 1.
 One time this coefficient,
 which is this number, right?
 And coding coefficient is 0.
 Zero time
 this number. Does that make sense to you?
 Now, how to do that in
 program?
 Have you learned this one?
 Now, first we define
 two
 result numbers.
 So, that's the coefficient, right?
 Okay, we have four numbers here.
 So, the intercept, the coefficient
 for hour,
 the coefficient for
 coding 9,
 and the coefficient for proficiency.
 You following?
 And then I define
 a list of numbers, right?
 Or call factor, right?
 That contains all the
 electors.
 We start with 1.
 Hour is 10.
 Coding 9 is
 1.
 Coding coefficient is 0.
 So, what's so good?
 What I want to do now, what the
 this time is
 x time coefficient.
 So, what's so good?
 It will give you
 it will give you another
 list of functions, right? That take the product
 of each pair.
 So, 1 times 8,
 10 times hour,
 10 times
 coefficient for hour,
 1 times
 the coefficient
 for none,
 and 0
 times the coefficient
 for proficiency.
 Now, you follow?
 Now, raise your hand if you cannot follow.
 Yes or no?
 What was the
 question?
 You show up here, right?
 So, again,
 a list of
 number, right?
 That's going to take the product of each term.
 Finally, you have to sum
 together, right?
 They will give you a sum
 of those
 numbers,
 those products.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Now, even if you're not familiar,
 you can do it by hand. It's not very difficult, right?
 Okay?
 You have to do the hand calculation, right?
 1 intercept
 plus 8 times this number,
 plus 1 times this number, 0 times this number,
 right? But you want to do it
 in program, right? That's the right way
 to do it. Default, one more time.
 Let me
 get back to
 R.
 Let me get back to
 the sweep.
 Alright, so let me get the
 coefficient
 of the final model, right?
 Now, let's return the coefficient
 of the final model.
 The equation for the
 coefficient for the equation, right?
 Let me call coefficient.
 Alright, now put the time together.
 X naught times
 the coefficient.
 And then sum all the products,
 right?
 This will give the long arc.
 Is it okay?
 Put the
 code in here.
 Any questions so far?
 Now, let me double-check,
 right? So let me run those
 one to curl,
 one to command, and see what we get.
 So, X naught
 is a list of input, right?
 A list of value of the predictor.
 Okay, coefficient.
 We got a list of coefficients
 from the equation.
 Which are on this side, right? Those are the coefficients, right?
 X naught times
 the coefficient.
 Give me the product of those, right?
 Now, this is the intercept here.
 Our 10 times the coefficient,
 10 times 1.167
 is 1.167, right?
 Coding none is 1, right?
 So, we get a C number here.
 Zero time
 coefficient. For proficiency,
 it's also zero, right?
 Now we add together.
 Alright, summing up.
 Then we'll give back
 the long arc.
 So, is it good? So there's the long arc, right?
 Any questions so far?
 Now, once you get the long arc,
 okay, you can get
 the arcs.
 How to do that?
 E to power
 long arc, right?
 Long arc,
 equal to
 E to power
 arc, long arc.
 Okay?
 And finally, the problem is
 given by
 arc over long arc.
 You want a big jump?
 You can jump from long arc to probability, right?
 How?
 By this transformation.
 By this transformation.
 So, the probability is given by
 arc
 over
 long arc.
 Alright, let me execute
 commands.
 So, long arc.
 Long arc,
 arc,
 and probability.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Let me call my number.
 Let me just write my experiment.
 This is long arc.
 This is
 long arc.
 Okay.
 And this is probability.
 0.09 by 8,
 1.10%, right?
 10% chance.
 Well, I can see, right?
 You spend 10 hours
 studying a week,
 but no whole experiment,
 the chance applies to this for only 10%.
 Oh my god.
 No matter how hard you are, right?
 The chance is only 10%, even if you have no whole experiment.
 Right?
 Alright, let's try
 intermediate.
 Now,
 if students have
 intermediate experiment,
 okay,
 how can you
 set the dummy variable?
 That means actually what?
 For intermediate, right?
 So be
 0, is that right?
 Right?
 It's intermediate, not non-proficiency, right?
 Calling proficiency also
 is also 0, right?
 Hour, we make unchanged 10.
 Right?
 So now, plus we calculate
 we estimate the whole 30, right?
 With those we put
 0.
 Silver with
 intermediate experiment.
 Right, the first intercept
 is 1, right?
 Hours 10,
 both dummy are 0.
 So now,
 let's execute the command, right?
 It's the same command, but the input is different.
 Do you follow?
 Who needs help?
 Any question?
 Alright, the log arc is
 negative 1.3,
 0.9,
 for port
 is given a 0.27,
 and for 30
 is given by
 0.2126.
 Alright?
 So what about probability, right?
 So far so good. Now do it one more time.
 What about proficiency?
 Now, if a student has proficiency
 experience,
 coding is still 0, right?
 And coding proficiency
 will be
 no, proficiency, right, will be 1.
 So look what proficiency we have.
 Does this make sense to you?
 The hour, we make a change,
 right?
 So far so good.
 Did you follow?
 Everything is fine?
 Let me execute the commands,
 and get the result.
 Log arc,
 arc,
 arc,
 and probability,
 log arc,
 negative 0.7,
 0.9,
 0.7,
 0.4,
 0.6,
 0.7,
 0.3,
 0.5,
 0.5,
 1.
 5.
 1.
 5.
 Right, so far so good.
 Alright, one more time. Give me any question about a calculation.
 Are you going to follow what I did?
 You're going to do that on the midterm, okay? Are you even going to do that? Yeah?
 So, okay, no problem?
 Great.
 Alright, next question.
 Determine the equation that used the number of hours to predict the probability of passing the course
 for a student with low coding experience, with intermediate coding experience, or proficiency coding experience.
 Now, this time I want to get an equation, not a number. Is that clear?
 Alright, how do I get it?
 Let me grab the equation first.
 Here's the model, right?
 The model 4 is given by the linear function of all predictors, right?
 Now, if students have no coding experience, coding none will be what?
 Zero, good.
 Zero, right?
 And what else? Alright.
 And coding proficiency, I'll just show you, it will be one by the way, not zero, it will be one.
 Sorry about that.
 What about coding proficiency?
 It's zero, you're right, good.
 Zero, you're right.
 Okay.
 Now, zero times whatever number is zero, right?
 So this time is gone, is that right?
 This time is gone.
 So now that we have those terms, right?
 Now, one time the coefficient for none is given by the same coefficient, right?
 Let me say to you, one time the coefficient for none is given by the same coefficient, right?
 So this is given by...
 Alright, so we can take this number, combine with the intercept, right?
 I'll give you...
 So it's good.
 Now, we got a new equation, right?
 It's the intercept plus the coefficient for none plus the linear term of hour.
 That makes sense to you.
 If we follow the algebra, alright?
 Now we call the intercept A...
 A is estimated to be...
 negative 2.98, right?
 Okay?
 And the coefficient for none...
 is estimated to be...
 to be 0.16...
 sorry, negative 0.9448, right?
 So let's add together or together?
 So A plus the coefficient for none equal to...
 negative 2.9834 plus the coefficient for coding none...
 is negative 3.8792, right?
 So far so good.
 Do you follow what I did?
 Is everyone okay?
 Is everyone okay?
 So the equation given by...
 the whole part given by negative 3.8792...
 plus the coefficient for hour, right?
 So we call the coefficient for hours given by 0.167417, right?
 Here we go.
 That is the equation to estimate the log-ort, is that right?
 The log-ort, right?
 Does it make sense to you?
 Anyone question?
 Are you able to follow?
 Are you able to follow here?
 No problem?
 Alright.
 When we get the log-ort, we can get the probability...
 the estimate probability is given by...
 E to log-ort...
 over 1 plus E to log-ort.
 Does it make sense to you?
 When we get log-ort from this equation, we can get the estimate probability.
 Any questions so far?
 So that's the way how we get the equation...
 that predicts the probability of a student passing the course...
 based on the hour, right?
 Any questions so far?
 Alright, just need a little break, alright?
 Alright, let's do the same thing for intermediate experience.
 Alright, now, if students have intermediate coding experience...
 Now, coding number will be what?
 Zero.
 And coding coefficient also?
 Zero, right? Good.
 Now, zero times whatever number is also zero, right?
 So the last two terms basically gone, is that right?
 The last two terms are gone, left with these two terms, right?
 Intercept plus coefficient of hour times the hour, is that right?
 Does it make sense to you?
 Now, we call, right?
 The coefficient of A is estimated to be negative 2.98.
 And the coefficient of hour is estimated to be 0.1674.
 Therefore, the equation that predicts the probability is given by...
 So, negative 2.98 plus 0.16 times the hour.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Any questions so far?
 Is that okay?
 No questions, yeah?
 Did we find the problem?
 Now, let me do the last one.
 Student has proficiency coding experience.
 Now, if student has proficiency coding experience, coding number should be what?
 Zero, good.
 All right, and coding proficiency will be one, you're right.
 Now, zero times whatever number is also zero, right?
 So, this term is gone.
 All right, it isn't gone, right?
 Anyone come back over?
 This term, this term, and this term, right?
 All right, now, since coding proficiency is one, one time, whatever number, give a C number, right?
 It will give back proficiency, the coefficient for proficiency.
 Therefore, we have that we can combine these coefficients, right, with the intercept A.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Does it make sense?
 All right, now we have to put in the estimate of those values, right?
 Now, I'll let you do that, I'll let you do that, right, okay?
 Any questions so far?
 Any questions so far?
 I'll let you define out the estimate of those numbers, right, and then combine together.
 Is that clear?
 Okay, we are going to do the next question.
 May I move on?
 All right, question G, interpret the regression proficiency for each dummy variable.
 Now, there are two dummy variables.
 One is the dummy variable as the coefficient for none, right, coding none, is that right?
 No experience.
 The other coefficient is for coding proficiency, is that right?
 So how do I interpret these two coefficients?
 These two, right?
 All right, so here's what I do.
 So let's interpret the regression proficiency for coding none, right, which is...
 All right, now recall from the previous part, right?
 The equation that used the number of hours to predict the probability of a student passing a course for a student with none experience, no experience, is given by this one, right?
 It's a log r equals to a plus the coefficient for none, right, for coding none, plus the coefficient for hour times the hour.
 Is that right?
 So what's so good?
 All right.
 Now let me get the other equation.
 Which one?
 I want to get an equation that used to predict the probability of passing the course for a student with intermediate experience.
 This is the one.
 So what's so good?
 Okay, this is four.
 None or no experience.
 This is four. Intermediate experience.
 Are you okay with that?
 All right, here's what I want to do.
 I want to take a different between these two equations.
 I want to subtract the difference between these two equations.
 Now this is different, right?
 First we got on the left-hand side, we got the difference between log r, right?
 There's a change in the log r.
 Okay, between student with no experience and intermediate experience.
 So what's so good?
 Does that make sense to you?
 On the left-hand side, we're going to change in the log r.
 All right, now on the right-hand side, we're going to do some cancellation, right?
 Now a, can we cancel, right?
 You see, can we cancel intercept?
 a is gone, right?
 What else is gone?
 The hours.
 The hour, right? The whole term here, right?
 This term is also gone, right?
 Which term is survived?
 The coefficient for coding none, right?
 Okay, now you can see, now based on this, right?
 You can say the coefficient for the w variable coding none is the change,
 is the change in the log r between student with no experience and intermediate experience.
 Is that clear or not? Does that make sense to you?
 Now you may wonder why I compare a student with no experience with intermediate experience.
 Now we call intermediate experience as a reference category.
 All students remember, right? As a reference category.
 In this case, right, all w are zero.
 Now based on the output, right, we know coding none is given by what's the number?
 So let me just write that for you, right?
 So beta, so the change in the log r is given by,
 the change in the log r between student with no experience and intermediate experience
 is given by the coefficient for none.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Now let's take a look at this coefficient that we call the coefficient.
 Okay.
 Or no, it's none experience, right?
 Estimate to be is negative point i, right?
 Now these numbers are negative, is that right? Negative, right?
 What does this mean?
 The log r of passing for student with no experience is lower than the student with intermediate experience.
 Is that clear?
 Now you can double check the calculation we did before.
 This calculation, right?
 Now, if student have no experience, the log r is only negative 2.21, right?
 When the student have more experience, right?
 When the student have intermediate experience, right?
 The log r is essentially go up.
 Okay, go up, right?
 To negative 1.3.
 Okay, that's higher, right? Does that make sense to you?
 Okay, by how much?
 By that number, right? Okay, log r, right?
 Okay, 2.2.
 Let me double check, right?
 Negative point i, right? Okay.
 So therefore, we say, right, we estimate the log r of passing the course.
 The course, okay, is for student who has no experience is lower than those with intermediate experience.
 Okay, by how much?
 By 0.9.
 Now, don't say negative 0.9.
 Reason is the negative sign has been represented by negative.
 Does that make sense to you?
 So far so good.
 Any questions so far?
 One more thing.
 Now, sometimes we don't write log r.
 What do you want? You want log r instead of log r, right?
 How can you get the log r?
 How can you get the log r?
 By e to power something, right?
 e to power something.
 Therefore, we can also say,
 or this is equivalent to say,
 we estimate the log r of passing the course for students who have no experience is 1.
 Now, it's still lower or higher?
 It's still lower, right?
 Because this is a negative coefficient, right?
 Right?
 If you give me a fraction below 1, right?
 Lower than those with intermediate experience by a factor of 0.904.
 Is that okay?
 So far so good?
 Or by 0.904.
 We're getting smaller, right?
 The number is getting smaller.
 Does that make sense to you?
 0.1 CO9?
 Okay.
 Or by 0.002%, right?
 Let me double check here.
 About 10%.
 By 9.5%.
 I'd like to figure out why, okay?
 Okay?
 But if you just leave it like that, I'm fine with that.
 No problem.
 But why 9.5%?
 I'd like to figure out by yourself.
 Is that number?
 I think that number is called the log r.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 I didn't get a lot more right.
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 I need to follow up 0.904, right?
 This is 0.4 CO4, okay?
 So by the low by a factor of 0.04, right?
 So far so good?
 Alright.
 Now, two things I want to mention, right?
 In this case, we compare the odds of passing the course for students with no experience with those with intermediate experience, right?
 And the intermediate experience is the reference category.
 Is that correct or not?
 Reference category.
 That's why we call it reference, right?
 We want to compare the student with no experience with the reference.
 What's the reference?
 Intermediate experience.
 No, that's okay.
 That's the reference category.
 Alright, I think this is time out, right?
 But let me do one more thing in five minutes.
 I want to do the last one, right?
 So what about the other coefficient?
 The other coefficient, right?
 So this is coding for intermediate, is that right?
 Now, how to interpret the code intermediate?
 Sorry, not intermediate.
 It's proficiency.
 So far so good?
 How to interpret this coefficient?
 It's the same thing, right?
 You want to compare the odds of students passing the course, okay?
 For the one who have proficiency experience with the one who have intermediate experience, is that right?
 Compare proficiency versus intermediate.
 So far so good?
 Why intermediate?
 Because it's a reference category.
 Does that make sense to you?
 So same kind of interpretation.
 So we estimate the log odds of passing the course for students who have proficiency experience.
 Now, let's look at the coefficient for this case.
 Now, the coefficient for proficiency is 0.6, right?
 Here, right?
 It's positive.
 What does this mean?
 The log odds, get the higher or lower?
 Greater.
 Greater, good.
 Okay, so this case is positive, right?
 So the number is higher than those with proficiency experience.
 How much?
 By 0.6.
 0.8, right?
 Now you can convert to odds instead of log odds, right?
 Which can lead to something, right?
 It can lead to power of 0.6.
 So we estimate the odds of passing the course for students who have proficiency experience
 is higher than those with intermediate experience by a factor of e to the power of 0.6.
 0, 0, 8.
 That is?
 One point?
 One point and two.
 Okay, right, one point and two.
 Thank you very much.
 So we are finished.
 Can you say this word five?
 What?
 Can you say this word five?
 Five?
 No, word five.
 This is word five.
 With the middle answer.
 Okay.
 And the goal.
 Any questions about that?
 No questions?
 Are you here to follow?
 Yeah?
 No problem?
 I'm not going to tell you the cheesy problem, right?
 I'm not going to talk to other people, okay?
 I'm going to find out.
 Okay?
 We have lots of time, right?
 Okay?
 Any questions about that?
 No questions?
 I want to take a break.
 Alright, no problem.
 Any questions about that?
 No.
 Alright.
