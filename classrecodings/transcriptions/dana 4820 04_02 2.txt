 The following variables are recorded. First, the number of hours they spent studying.
 Second is the exam outcome, either pass or fail. Pass or fail, right?
 Now let's call binary data, which is a collectable data with two categories.
 Make sense to you?
 Alright, now here is a model.
 Okay, here's a model for data.
 Now the objective of using the data is to use the number of hours as our predictor to model the probability of passing.
 Now I hope you know, right? I think it's common sense, right?
 If you spend more time studying, it will increase the chance of passing the exam, is that right?
 So we want to model this relationship.
 How to model this relationship? We use the logistic regression model.
 Now on the right-hand side, we have our linear function of the predictor hour.
 It's A plus B times the predictor, right?
 In this case, the hour. That is similar to the regression model, right?
 The ordinary regression model.
 Y is A plus Bx, right?
 Alright, so on the left side, on the right side, we have the linear function of the predictor hour.
 Now on the right side, okay, so on the left side, we have a function of probability.
 The probability of a student passing the exam, is that right?
 Now, I might explain many times, right?
 If you model the probability with a linear function, it will cause a problem.
 What's the problem?
 Now the linear function always returns any number between negative infinity to positive infinity, which are any real number.
 However, the probability must be between 0 and 1, right?
 Does this make sense to you?
 So that the left side is not aligned with the right side, is that right?
 Therefore, on the left side, we need a function of the probability,
 so that it will map the probability from 0 to 1 to any real number, from negative infinity to positive infinity.
 Therefore, the left side and right side are matched.
 Does this make sense to you?
 That's all purpose.
 Now, what we're going to do with this function is the law of P over 1 as P.
 First, there's a nice interpretation.
 The term inside the law is called odds, odds of the event.
 In this case, P represents the probability of a passing, right?
 This is called odds of passing.
 Altogether, it's called odds of an event.
 Is that clear?
 Have a nice interpretation.
 Also, we can rewrite the function in terms of P.
 Therefore, we can estimate the probability using the hour.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Write how to solve for P.
 The P can be written as E to the power of A plus Bx over 1 plus E to the power of A plus Bx.
 So much so good.
 From here, we can find the probability.
 We can estimate the probability based on x, based on the number of hours studying.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Alright.
 So we fit the logistic regression model to the data and obtain the output.
 After fitting the logistic model to the data,
 the first thing to do is to check whether the model is significantly useful
 in predicting the probability of passing.
 That's what we did last time.
 Now, once we have determined that the number of hours is a significant predictor
 of a student's probability of passing the exam,
 we can use the regression equation to predict the probability.
 Okay.
 The whole first thing to remember, right?
 Last thing, right?
 We learned how to test whether the model is significantly useful
 in predicting the probability of passing based on the hour, right?
 This equipment will say,
 we want to test whether the hours is a significant predictor of the probability.
 We did that, right?
 And we have strong evidence to show that, right?
 Hours is a necessary use as a predictor to predict the probability of passing.
 Is that right?
 Once we have determined the number of hours is a significant predictor
 of a student's probability of passing the exam,
 then we can use the regression equation to predict the probability
 based on the number of hours studied.
 To do that, we need to read the coefficient table from the regression output.
 Remember the output?
 When you fit the output, right?
 This is the regression output from R, right?
 We look at the coefficient table right here.
 The coefficient table, right?
 Now in the coefficient table, we look at the first column called estimate, right?
 Now in the model, there are two unknown parameters.
 One is A is called intercept, right?
 The other is called the smoke labeled by B, right?
 So we have to get the estimate of A and B in order to estimate the probability.
 Is that right?
 Alright, according to the output, the intercept is given by negative 2.8984.
 So that's good.
 And the slope, now the slope is labeled by the name of the predictor.
 The name of the predictor, right?
 Now when I fit the model, I need to use X, but X is just the hour.
 And the number is 0.6734, right?
 So the regression equation is given by log of P over mass P equals to negative 2.8984 plus 0.6734 times the hour.
 So that's good.
 Now we are ready to estimate the probability.
 Alright, now to estimate the probability, right?
 We need to rewrite the equation in terms of P.
 Remember the sheet I gave you, right?
 The summer sheet I gave you, right?
 We can rewrite the whole equation in terms of P.
 That is P equals to E to A plus BX over 1 plus E to B plus BX.
 Does that make sense?
 Now you don't need to drive by yourself, right?
 It's good to remember, right?
 But you cannot remember all the sheet I gave you.
 Do you have one?
 Do you have one, right?
 Alright, now we want to estimate the probability that our student will pass the exam if the student studied for zero hour.
 Wow, man, you know.
 You have an exam, but you don't study.
 You spend zero hour.
 Let's see the probability.
 How likely the student will pass the exam?
 We're putting zero into hour.
 Now zero times whatever number is zero, right?
 So the second term, the linear of the predicted term, the predicted term is gone. It's canceled.
 That would be intercept.
 So the problem is given by E to the power of negative 2.8984 over 1 plus E to negative 2.8984.
 Let's do the calculation.
 Bang.
 0.055.
 What's the chance?
 Well, it's about roughly 6%, right? 5-6%, right?
 Is it a good chance?
 Well, it's not too bad.
 You don't study.
 You don't spend any time, right?
 You know, okay.
 5%, not too bad.
 I think even lower.
 Well, at least higher than minus 6.49.
 Do you think so?
 Right?
 Not too bad.
 I would say it's a good chance if you don't spend any time to study.
 Right? No effort.
 That's the probability, right?
 Any questions so far?
 So if a student studied for zero hours, we estimate the probability of passing the exam is 0.055, roughly 5-6%.
 Now, the estimate probability we calculate always differ from the true value.
 Therefore, we always use a common interval that provides a range of positive value for the probability.
 Now, the probability we just calculate is a prediction.
 It may not be a true probability.
 You see what I'm saying, right?
 It's just an estimate.
 Therefore, we want to use a common interval to give a range of positive value,
 a range of reasonable estimate of this probability.
 And the common interval for the true probability is given by 40x value is calculated based on the fourth step.
 Now, honestly, I'm thinking we should give this kind of question on your assignment or exam, right?
 Because it's quite complicated, too.
 I'm not sure if you did that in the other class, right?
 Now, let's have a score, okay?
 I don't put this question on the assignment, right?
 I don't put this question on the assignment, all right?
 Now, first of all, we have to calculate the estimate law of the regression equation, right?
 First of all, we estimate the law of the event using the regression equation.
 Second, we have to calculate the variance of the log part.
 This is equivalent to calculate the variance of A plus B times X.
 Have you ever done that in the other class?
 Have you seen that before?
 Okay.
 Now, just a quick example, right?
 Now, you want to, from the previous class, right?
 You want to estimate Y based on A plus B times X, something like that, right?
 Okay?
 Now, of course, A and B is just the estimate from the sample data, okay?
 A and B is the estimate based on the sample data.
 Therefore, Y is also the estimate, right?
 You just have to predict that Y, okay?
 Now, how can you calculate the variance of the estimate?
 All right?
 Well, you need to take the variance of the whole expression.
 Well, you need to take the variance of the whole expression, A hat plus B hat times X.
 So, that's good.
 Now, how do you get the variance of this expression?
 Now, in this expression, they have two random variables.
 One is A hat out of B hat, because they both come from sample data, right?
 Therefore, these two estimates vary between samples.
 So, you can select another random sample.
 We got different estimates, right?
 Now, how to calculate the variance of this K?
 First, we take the variance of A hat and then plus the variance of B hat times X, second term, right?
 You're going to learn in the previous class if you find a variance of two random variables.
 Ever seen it before?
 And then plus one more term.
 It's called covariance.
 It's two times the covariance of A hat times B hat times X.
 Ever seen that before?
 Ever?
 Okay, let's forget it, okay?
 If that's the case, I won't waste my time to do that, right?
 I mean, in a real situation, you need to do some kind of calculation, right?
 Anyway, let's move on.
 All right, so let's do the exercise, okay?
 Suppose a student studied for one hour, this time one hour, right?
 Assuming the probability that the student will pass the exam, okay?
 Let's do the calculation by hand.
 Come on, let's do it now. Don't ruin my answer.
 Let me write down the equation, right?
 Okay.
 Well, recall, right?
 The estimate regression equation is given by
 log of E over 1 minus B, right?
 Equals to negative 2.
 2.8984 plus 0.6734 times the hour, right?
 So, let's recall from the same moment the P given by
 E to the power of negative 2.8984 plus 0.6734 times the hour
 over 1 plus E to the negative 2.8984 plus 0.6734 times the hour.
 So, what's so good?
 All right, this time the hour is what? What's the hour?
 Just one hour.
 This is one, right?
 Then the profit is given by
 I should be more precise. It's the estimate profit, right?
 It's given by E to the negative 2.8984 plus 0.6734
 over 1 plus E to the negative 2.8984 plus 0.6734.
 So, what's so good?
 So, now let's do the math. What do you get?
 Calculation, right?
 So, hours one, the linear part is
 I get 2.8984 plus 0.6734 times 1.
 All right, now I need to calculate the profit, right?
 E to the power of this number over 1 plus E to the power of this number.
 I got 0.797. Do you get the same thing?
 Now, here's a trick I calculate the number, right?
 First of all, I want to calculate these parts first.
 The predicted term, right?
 Get the number, which is negative 2.225.
 2.225 away, okay?
 So, what's so good?
 Therefore, this number is also negative 2225, right?
 Make sense to you?
 And use that for the next calculation.
 So, that is E to the power of negative 2.225
 over 1 plus E to the power of negative 2.225.
 In this way, you don't repeat the same calculation twice, okay?
 So, let's get the linear part, the prediction term,
 and use that for the next calculation.
 So far, so good.
 Make sense to you?
 So, you don't need to do the same calculation two times.
 Just one time, get a number, and then use it for the next calculation.
 Okay, right?
 What's the probability?
 Well, this time, better.
 0.797, right?
 What would be 10%?
 You don't spend one hour studying, the chance is not too bad.
 10% chance, okay?
 Of course, it's still low, right?
 Come on, only one hour.
 What do you expect?
 At least, the chance height is at least 49.
 So, it's the same.
 You guys see my work?
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 Oh, I guess you can't see it.
 All right, next.
 All right, now is the time to interpret the regression coefficient.
 Now, we call, there are two regression coefficients, right?
 What is called?
 A, which is intercept.
 The other is B, the slope, right?
 For now, let's focus on the intercept.
 How to interpret the intercept?
 Now, first, I want to set the hour to zero.
 I want to set the hour to zero.
 Zero times whatever number is zero, right?
 That means the second term is gone.
 Does this make sense to you?
 All right, so, the logistic regression model only contains the intercept A.
 The intercept A. Is that clear?
 So now, tell me what is the interpretation of the intercept A?
 What is the interpretation?
 Now, A is given by log of P over 1 minus P, which is the log-orth of passing the exam.
 Is that right?
 So the log-orth of our student passing the exam is predicted to be A if the student spends zero hours to study the exam, right?
 But here's the problem, the interpretation.
 You will go outside and talk to anyone.
 Did they know what's the log-orth?
 You will go outside.
 Hey, the log-orth is given by A.
 It's really odd, by the way.
 You just go to talk to your client, talk to your boss.
 Hey, the log-orth is given by A, right?
 So usually, we don't interpret log-orths.
 So most of the time, we want to interpret the orths, the orths of an event, not the log-orths.
 So most of the time, we want to interpret the orths, the orths of an event, not the log-orths.
 Okay?
 How to get the orths of an event?
 We can take the...
 Now, the log-orth is given by A, is that right?
 But I don't want log-orth.
 I want to remove the log.
 How do you do that?
 We have to find the inverse function, which is the exponential function, E, right?
 You E to both sides.
 E to house on both sides, right?
 Now E and log has a reciprocal relationship.
 That means E and log will kill each other.
 Okay?
 Left with their trial.
 When E meets log, it will kill each other.
 Left with their trial.
 Therefore, P over one last P is given by E to house A.
 Does that make sense to you?
 And this term is the orth of an event, right?
 What's the event we're looking for?
 It's passing the exam.
 So what's so good?
 Alright?
 So the orth of passing the exam is given by E to house A.
 Usually we interpret, we don't interpret A directly.
 We interpret E to house A, which is the orth of the events of interest.
 In this case, it's passing the exam.
 So the orth of a student passing the exam is predicted to be E to house A.
 Yet the student spends no hours to study.
 Alright, we call A is estimated to be negative 2.8984, right?
 Therefore, E to the power of negative 2.8984 is 0.055.
 As I said, we did a calculation before, right?
 It's going to be 5 to 6 percent.
 Now, I can express 0.055 as 5.5 over 100.
 Why I won't do that?
 Now, based on the orth, based on the orth, right?
 We can tell the probability of a student passing the exam is 0.055,
 as likely as the probability of a student failing the exam,
 if they spend no hours studying.
 Is that clear?
 Remember, the office compares two events.
 In this case, right, it's the probability of passing and the probability of failing.
 So much so good.
 Now look at the ratio, right?
 It's 0.055, right?
 That means the probability of passing is 0.055,
 as likely as the probability of failing the exam.
 Now, in other words, for every 100 students who fail the exam,
 Now, how to get 100, right?
 Remember, we can express the ratio of these two events, right, as 5.5 over 100, right?
 If I multiply top and bottom by a sample size n, say n here for example, right?
 What will it give me?
 It will give me the expected number of students who pass the exam
 over the expected number of students who fail the exam.
 Do you follow me?
 I will say it one more time, okay?
 I think we talked about this a long time ago, right?
 Now the odd, right, of passing is given by the probability of passing over the probability of failing.
 So much so good.
 Based on the logistic regression model, we estimate the ratio is 5.5 over 100.
 Make sense? Does it make sense to you?
 Alright, if I multiply a number, say n on the top and bottom, right?
 And refer to the sample size, any sample size you like, maybe 10.
 We select 10 students, 100 students doesn't really matter.
 This term becomes the expected number of students who pass the exam, is that okay?
 And the bottom term becomes the expected number of students who fail.
 So much so good.
 And the ratio of two expected numbers is still 5.5 over 100, right?
 Therefore, for every 100 students who fail the exam, we expect 5.5 of them pass the exam, given they spend zero hours to study.
 Is that clear or not?
 So much so good.
 May I get back to five points?
 Okay.
 For every 100 students who fail the exam, we expect about 5.5 students pass the exam, given they spend zero hours to study.
 Is that clear or not?
 Those students never study the exam.
 For every 100 students who fail, we only expect 5.5 of them pass.
 We can see, right?
 Passing is not common.
 Failing is more common, right?
 Than passing, because you don't spend time to study.
 What do you expect, right?
 So much so good.
 Any questions so far?
 May I move on?
 Alright, next we need to interpret the slope coefficient for the hour.
 Now let's interpret the slope.
 Again, back to the original form, right?
 The long odds of passing the exam is given by A plus B times hour, right?
 Okay.
 Let me answer it, okay?
 Right here, that's the right one.
 Alright.
 Alright, how do we interpret?
 Now first of all, I want to set the hour to K.
 K is any number.
 Can be 1 hour, can be 2 hour, can be 3 hour, can be 4 hour, can be 10 hour, can be 100 hour.
 So K is any arbitrary hour, is that clear or not?
 So let's set the hour to be K.
 So now we have A plus B times K equals to log of P over 1 minus P.
 Now I put a subscript K beside P, right?
 In the K, P with a subscript K is a probability that a student will pass the exam if they study for K hour.
 Set K can be 1, can be 2, can be 3, can be 100.
 Can be any arbitrary, so also good.
 So altogether, that is the log odds of passing the exam given by A plus B times K, right?
 It's the log odds of passing the exam if students spend K hours to study.
 Okay.
 Now we want to set the hour to K plus 1.
 If a student spends more hours, one extra hour to study on top of K, which is K plus 1, right?
 So hour becomes K plus 1, is that right?
 So what's so good?
 Does it make sense to you?
 Let's say another student also spends more hours to study.
 How many hours? K plus 1.
 One hour beats the previous student.
 Let's say I study K hours.
 You study K plus 1 hour.
 1 hour beats mine, okay?
 Alright, so the log odds of passing given by A plus B times K plus 1.
 Now all of a subscript K plus 1 here, beside P, right?
 In the K, this is the probability that a student will pass the exam if they study for K plus 1 hour.
 So that's so good.
 Everything's clear?
 Are you going to follow?
 Any questions? Okay, good.
 Now we'll simplify the algebra.
 Okay, now this is B times K plus 1, right?
 I can multiply B to each term of K plus 1.
 First, B times K gives you BK, right?
 And B times 1 gives you B. So what's so good?
 Therefore, the log odds of passing the exam is given by A plus BK plus B.
 So what's so good?
 Okay, move to the next slide.
 Alright, now we want to take the difference between two log odds, okay?
 For studying K hours and K plus 1 hours.
 We'll take a difference.
 Alright, let's see. Any cancellation?
 On the left-hand side, we still have the difference between two log odds, is that right?
 On the right side, there's some cancellation.
 Do you see any cancellation?
 Any cancellation?
 This term minus this term.
 Do you see any cancellation?
 A is cancelled, right?
 What else?
 Just A?
 BK, you're right!
 It's going to cancel.
 Left with B. B is a slope, right?
 Okay, here we go. B right here, right?
 Therefore, the difference in the log odds of passing between K and K plus 1 hour is given by the slope B.
 So far, so good.
 Alright, now let's clean up the left-hand side.
 How can I clean up the left-hand side?
 Do you remember the log rule?
 Now, one of the log rules is log of A over B is given by log of A minus log of B.
 So we can combine these two terms as a single log.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Let's combine together, okay?
 Mathematically, we can combine two log terms in a single log.
 That is log of the odds of passing given hours K plus 1 over the log of passing given students spending K hours.
 Is that clear or not?
 Now, together, it's called art ratio.
 We're going to study art ratio later, right?
 It's called art ratio.
 It's a ratio of two art, right?
 The log art ratio is given by the slope B.
 So far, so good.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Alright.
 Now, if you don't like the log, like I said, right?
 Log is not interminable.
 People don't understand log.
 They understand odds, but not odds.
 Not log odds, right?
 People understand the odds, but they don't understand log odds.
 Therefore, I want to remove the log on the left side, right?
 How to do that?
 We do the same trick, right?
 We take E on both sides, right?
 E to the power of something.
 I put E on both sides, right?
 As I said, E and log have a reciprocal relationship.
 That means E and log would view each other.
 They go on, they both cancel, left with their trial.
 Therefore, the art ratio is given by E to the power of B.
 So far, so good.
 Any questions so far?
 Here's the interpretation of the slope.
 For every additional hour spent studying for an exam,
 we predict that the log odds of a student passing the exam increase by B, right?
 Or we can say we predict the odds of passing the exam
 increase by a factor of E to the power of B.
 Are you trying to increase, right?
 If you assume B is bigger than zero, is that clear?
 Here's a question for you.
 If B is less than zero, does the odds increase or decrease?
 Now, if B is positive, it's bigger than zero, right?
 If B is positive, it's bigger than zero, right?
 E to B, now, it gives you a factor, right?
 Always bigger than...
 Hopefully by the same way, it's always bigger than one, right?
 This is the exponential function, E to B, right?
 When B is zero, it's this one, right?
 Up this way.
 What happens if B is less than zero?
 If B is less than zero, right?
 Now, the power is negative, right?
 You can rewrite as E to...
 Sorry, you can write negative absolute by B.
 So far, so good.
 You got negative power, right?
 You got negative power, right?
 That is one over E to negative B.
 I'm sorry, B, right?
 This number, always less than zero.
 Sorry, less than one, right?
 Now, if a factor is bigger than one,
 we can say this quantity increased by a factor of this value, right?
 If B is less than zero, the factor becomes less than one.
 Let's do it again, zero, okay?
 Less than one, right?
 That means this quantity decreased, getting smaller.
 Does this make sense to you?
 For example, right?
 Let's say $100.
 You invest $100 on a stock, right, for example.
 If your investment, okay,
 grows or increases by a factor of, let's say, two,
 that means your investment becomes 200, is that right?
 Better than the original.
 However, if the investment is increased by a number, let's say, 0.5,
 what does this mean?
 Your investment becomes smaller, right?
 But how much by a factor of 0.5, which is get to $100,
 or get to $50, that's a bad thing.
 That's what I'm trying to say, right?
 If your factor is bigger than one,
 the quantity, getting bigger.
 If a factor is less than one, the quantity becomes smaller.
 Does this make sense to you?
 So say right here, right?
 If the slope is bigger than zero, right,
 the odds of students passing is getting bigger.
 When you spend more hours studying, does this make sense to you?
 On the other hand, right, if the slope is less than zero,
 the odds actually decrease, okay, by a factor of E to the power of B.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Any discussion?
 Now, on the assignment, you pay attention, right, you know?
 Look at the trend of value, is that thing positive or negative?
 And provide correct interpretation.
 All right, so if P is less than zero, the odds will decrease.
 Okay, decrease, right?
 And I said, right, when B is bigger, when B is less than zero,
 you can write as one over E to B, right?
 If B is less than zero, it doesn't make a number, right?
 Okay, and this factor is way less than one.
 That's why the quantity always decreases.
 So what's so good?
 May I move on?
 All right, recall, the slope B is estimated to be 0.6734.
 Now, let's calculate E to 0.6734.
 I got 1.96, 1.32, okay, not exactly, but 1.32.
 Therefore, for every additional hour spent studying for the exam,
 we predict the odds of a student passing the exam increase
 by a factor of 1.96, or no double.
 You spend an additional hour to study, just one hour,
 the odds will go up, or no double.
 Not exactly, but no double, right?
 Or you can say increase by a percentage.
 How much? 96%.
 I'm thinking about why, by the way.
 Now, we can say, okay, the odds increase by a factor of 1.96.
 No problem, no double, right?
 You can say the odds increase by 96%.
 Now, not 20%, okay?
 You can think of why.
 Now, most people prefer a second one,
 because they like the percentage, right?
 Now, the factor is 1.96, right?
 But why does it become 96% instead of 1.96% or 100%?
 Anyone can tell me?
 No probability.
 Okay.
 I'm not sure whether it's not hard to calculate the percent of increase.
 Now, the percent of increase or decrease, right,
 of a quantity is given by, in a quantity, the Q, right,
 is given by the new quantity
 minus the old quantity divided by the old quantity.
 Remember this one?
 Quality can be investment,
 can be the amount of investment, the amount of money in your pocket,
 the exam grade, the height, the weight, whatever.
 Now, we know the new quantity, right,
 is given by 1.96 times the old quantity.
 Does this make sense to you?
 In this case, right, the quantity is the odds of passing.
 So much so good.
 Now, based on the slope, right,
 you can say the odds of passing increased by 1.96, right,
 by a factor of 1.96.
 That means the new odds increased by,
 it's given by 1.96 times the old quantity, is that right?
 So 1.96 times the old quantity
 minus the old quantity
 over the old quantity, right?
 That's the total time of the same, by the way.
 Do you see a cancellation?
 Do you see a cancellation?
 The old quantity are all cancelled, is that right?
 What with 1.96 minus 1 and times 100%, right?
 Which is 96%.
 We look at the percent change.
 The percentage is not 1.96, it's only 96%.
 Does this make sense to you?
 But anyway, if you interpret as a factor of 1.96, I accept it.
 If you say 96%, I also accept it.
 This is up to you, right, in this class.
 But when you go out and work,
 most people prefer the second one.
 They like percentage.
 Don't see how much increase in terms of percentage,
 except the actual number.
 Does it make sense to you?
 But of course, I don't mind, you know?
 Okay.
 Any questions so far?
 Do you want to move on?
 Then I'll finish the class earlier.
 Now, let's do some examples.
 Do damage, right?
 This is correct.
 Now, we call for continuous calculation.
 Now, if a student spent for a study for zero hour,
 the odds of passing is estimated to be 0.255.
 Is that right?
 We did the calculation before, right?
 Now, that means for every 100 students who fail,
 we expect about 5.5 students who pass.
 All right, if students study for one hour,
 one additional hour on top of zero, okay?
 We expect...
 So the odds of passing is estimated to be 0.108.
 You can double check, right, the calculation, okay?
 That means for every 100 students who fail,
 we expect about 10.8 students who pass.
 Now, look at the number of students who pass.
 From original 5.5, jump to 10.8.
 That's all we're talking about.
 Does it make sense to you?
 So far, so good?
 Any questions so far?
 Okay.
 So it's all about the expected number of students
 who pass exams for every 100 students who fail.
 So that's all good.
 Now, on the midterm, right, you know,
 not now, but not next week, don't worry, okay?
 I may ask you to feed the blank, okay?
 Make sure you pick the right number to feed the blank.
 Any questions so far?
 So you have to know, understand the meaning of odds, okay?
 All right.
 One last thing, all right?
 The confident for the regression coefficient.
 Now, just recall, right?
 Now, in the logistic model,
 there are two parameters, right?
 A, the intercept, and B, the slope time x, is that right?
 Now, for the data,
 we can estimate A and B through problem, right?
 Okay, we can estimate the parameter
 based on sample data, right?
 So that's just the estimate.
 The number we use to do calculations
 are just the estimate, is that right?
 We want to know the true value.
 So imagine, right, you've got the data
 from the entire population,
 and use it to fit the logistic model, okay?
 I want to know what is, what are the value of A and B
 if you've got the data from the population?
 Now, obviously, right, the one from sample data, okay,
 is not same as the one from population, is that right?
 Therefore, we prefer to use a complementable
 to get a range of possible value, okay, for A and B.
 Does it make sense to you?
 I can say it one more time, right?
 Now, let's pretend we want to get the value of A and B
 from the population data, not the sample, right?
 And obviously, the value not from the population data
 but we get from, what we got from the sample.
 Let's make example, right?
 Let's say you use the data from population,
 the true value of A is, let's say it's 0.3, for example,
 let's make a number, right, negative 0.3,
 and the true value of B is 0.8, for example, right?
 Now, obviously, the one we got from the sample
 is not same as the true value, right?
 Not the same.
 Therefore, I won't use a complementable
 that capture the true value of A and B.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Okay.
 How do we get a complementable?
 It's straightforward.
 We take the S a lot, from the S a lot, okay,
 of the parameter plus or minus the Z critical value
 times the standard error of the S a lot regression coefficient.
 That's it.
 And all the number can be find from the output.
 So based both the S a lot regression coefficient
 and the standard error can be find in the coefficient table.
 Now, what is the coefficient table?
 Now, let's start from intercept.
 The S a lot is negative 2.8984, right?
 Okay.
 And the standard error is 0.9694.
 It basically tells you on average,
 the S a lot differ from the true value
 by about 0.9694, right?
 That's the difference on average.
 Now, look at the slope.
 Now, the slope is 0.6734, right?
 And the standard error is 0.186.
 It say the S a lot of the slope differ
 from its true value by about 0.186 zero, right?
 All right.
 So let's calculate the 95% complementable for the A.
 First, we take the S a lot, negative 2.8987,
 plus or minus, okay,
 the C critical value times the standard error 0.9694.
 All right.
 Now, this is just a standard error.
 It's the average difference, okay?
 But the average cannot be the marginal error, okay?
 Standard error is not big enough to be a marginal error, right?
 That's why we have to find the right critical value,
 the right constant to make the error big enough.
 Okay, now, the critical value is called C critical value, right?
 That means it comes from the normal distribution.
 Now, we call at 95% complementable,
 what is the critical value?
 Remember?
 1.96.
 1.96, good.
 Please remember this one, 1.96, okay?
 I only use 1.96, that's it.
 Always remember, right?
 At 95% complementable,
 okay,
 this is 1.96.
 What does this mean?
 Let's say draw a normal curve,
 draw a normal curve, right?
 Okay, and select the region in the middle,
 and shade that.
 This is 95%, right?
 And the cut point C score is given by
 negative 1.96 and 1.96.
 So that's good.
 Basically said, okay?
 Basically said, right?
 The estimate of the slope differ from the true value
 by about two times the standard error.
 Two times the standard error.
 We call, right?
 Almost 95% of data can be captured in that range, right?
 That's what I'm saying.
 Most of the time,
 the estimate of the slope differ from the true value
 by about two standard deviations.
 Anyway, that's the calculation, right?
 So let's do some calculation.
 I got negative 4.798 and negative 0.9983.
 So the true value of the intercept
 might be negative 4.5,
 negative 4.6,
 negative 3,
 negative 3.5,
 negative 2.
 Any number in between 4.7 and 0.998.
 May I move on?
 Now let's interpret the common interval
 for the intercept.
 Now recall,
 the worth of a student passing the exam
 is predicted to be e to the power of a.
 Now not a, okay?
 e to the power of a.
 Yet the student spends zero hours studying,
 is that right?
 Now the interval we obtain is for a,
 not for e to the power of a, is that clear or not?
 Okay?
 From the previous calculation,
 we only got the interval for a.
 Okay, so 9,
 d plus n, c, i,
 for a
 is given by
 negative
 negative 4.7
 98
 and negative
 0.9983, is that right?
 But to interpret a, right?
 We don't want more odds.
 We want odds, is that right?
 So what is the question?
 What is the 95% common interval
 for e to a?
 That's the big point.
 Does it make sense to you?
 e to a, not just a.
 It's straightforward, right?
 We just take e to the power of the interval
 and that's it.
 There we go.
 So the 95% of e to the power of a
 is given by e to the interval.
 So we got two numbers, right?
 e to negative 4.798
 and e to negative 0.9983.
 Does it make sense?
 We just simply apply
 the common interval into the function.
 That's it.
 So we got two numbers, right?
 0.0082 and 0.9685.
 So in the interpretation,
 in the population,
 now not just in the sample,
 in the population of all individuals,
 we are 95% confident
 that the odds
 of a student passing the exam
 is somewhere between 0.0082
 and 0.3685
 if our students study for zero hours.
 Now you can see the true model
 is pretty low, by the way.
 Okay?
 There's 0.0082 and 0.3685, right?
 The range is pretty wide as well.
 It doesn't look like much data.
 Okay?
 The interval is not that precise.
 You can see, right?
 The range is pretty wide, right?
 You get a big data,
 it's different story.
 Any questions so far?
 Please follow the picture, okay?
 Okay.
 Can you move on?
 All right, next one.
 Let's calculate the confident interval
 for the slope.
 All right, let's bring the formula.
 Would it be estimate?
 Plus or minus the second value.
 Time is then the error.
 All right.
 We call the slope is estimated
 to be 0.6734, right?
 The standard error is 0.1860.
 The curricula is still 1.96.
 So let's compare the calculation.
 I got 0.308A and 1.03A.
 I may move on.
 Okay.
 Now we call the interpretation of the slope.
 Okay?
 Now for each additional hour spent studying for the exam,
 we predict, we estimate
 the art of a student passing the exam
 increased by a factor of E to the power of B
 if B is less than 0,
 or decreased by a factor of E to the power of B
 if B is less than 0.
 Sounds good.
 In this case, right, you tell me
 the value of B.
 Now, if you pay attention, okay?
 Now, what is the confident interval?
 Now, we estimate the slope B
 is somewhere between 0.308A and 1.03A.
 That means the slope can be 0.5,
 can be 0.6,
 can be 0.7,
 0.8,
 0.9,
 or even 1.
 Any number in the interval
 might be a true value of the slope.
 Is that okay?
 Now look at all the possible values.
 What is the common feature of those numbers?
 You're right. They're all possible.
 You're right. Absolutely.
 Now, this is correctly reported, right?
 Now, as you can see,
 every interval,
 so every number in the interval is positive.
 That means the slope,
 even though we never know the true value of the slope,
 the slope should be positive.
 Sounds good.
 It's just like, hey, Ken, I know your age.
 I know your age between 0 and 100.
 100.
 Obviously, it can't be bigger than zero years old.
 It's positive.
 Is that right?
 Same idea, right?
 Now, since the slope is positive,
 we are pretty sure, right,
 the odds should increase,
 right, should increase,
 when we spend more hours to study.
 Sounds good?
 By how much?
 By the fraction of E to the power of B.
 Right?
 So let's get the interval for E to the power of B.
 Now, we call the interval for B is given by 0.32AA
 and 1.338, right?
 Now, we take the E to the power of the interval.
 We got two numbers, 1.362 and 2.823.
 Here's the interpretation.
 In the population, we are pretty confident.
 How much?
 95% confident that the odds of a student passing the exam
 increase by a factor.
 Now, not just two.
 By between 1.362 or 2.823.
 Or you can say increase by between 36.2% and 182.3%.
 Why?
 Let you think about that, okay?
 Any questions so far?
 I think this is the end of the lecture, okay?
 That is the time to do the assignment, right, okay?
 What time is that?
 It's 5.38 by loss of time, okay?
 Now, let me quickly go and get the assignment.
 So last day, we did the first two problems, right?
 Pretty straightforward.
 How to fit the logistic reversal model, right?
 Today, we have to do more before you leave the class, okay?
 Let me bring the beads up, okay?
 I'm going to go and bring it.
 I'm going to bring the beads up, okay?
 I'm going to bring the beads up, okay?
 Alright, now this is the assignment, okay?
 This is the assignment, right?
 You get that one for twice a day.
 Now, last day, we finished question A and question B, right?
 Today, you have to do something in front of me, and you can go home.
 Alright, how about question C?
 Okay, now question C, you want to evaluate the statistical significance.
 Basically, you want to check whether the model is significantly useful in predicting the probability.
 That can be question C, right? That's okay, okay?
 Now, I also changed question D a little bit, right?
 Now, question D asks, compute the estimate odds of the loan default for a borrower with annual income of $20,000, by the way, okay?
 Just one number, right?
 And interpret the odds.
 So, do calculation and also interpret the result.
 Does this make sense to you? I just add this part, right?
 Now, for today's assignment, just complete question C.
 You're free to go.
 Alright, and then do the rest when you go home, that's it.
 Does this make sense to you? Okay.
 So, that's the question C.
 Alright, that's the question C.
 Now, remember last day, right, we fit the production model to the data, right?
 But we haven't checked whether the model is significantly useful in predicting the probability of the loan default, right?
 We haven't do that.
 So, what we learned today, now we're doing an approach.
 First, use the war test, okay?
 Firstly, look at the PNA, you have the coefficient, right?
 For the slope.
 The other one is do likelihood ratio test.
 You have to do some calculation, right?
 Now, for me, question C, show to me.
 See you next day.
 And do the rest of the question at home.
 And that's it.
 Okay.
 Alright.
 Okay.
 Well, I just update the assignment, right?
 I'll update question D.
 Alright, calculate the parts of loan default, okay?
 The person follow up with the income, $20,000, right?
 And interpret the odds.
 Interpret the odds.
 One thing I want to say before I get to the assignment, right?
 Now, I post up with your question for the quiz.
 But I said like the quiz will be canceled.
 Okay, no more quiz.
 But I do want you to practice question, okay?
 For the midterm.
 Here's the review, right?
 So the two reviews.
 One for comparing multiple proportions.
 The other one is maximum likelihood estimation.
 And likelihood ratio test.
 Right, I did a review question right now.
 And this was all solution.
 We got to have time to write it, right?
 Okay, I'm going to update it.
 This is for the quiz.
 But anyway, enjoy the midterm.
 Enjoy the midterm, right?
 You do have some things to do, right?
 Okay, so no problem.
 I don't think we have quiz.
 The first question, I'll decide, okay?
 Let me send to you.
 Then, you know, you won the first quiz.
 No problem.
 I'll give you the first quiz if you want.
 Okay, yeah.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 You have to show me that you have things I don't know.
 Because I don't know how to calculate, right?
 So, if I'm going to help you, why are you?
 I'm going to use my tool to check it.
 What's the critical value?
 What's the critical value?
 No, the critical value.
 Maybe I'm wrong.
 What's the critical value?
 Oh, no.
 I'm holding the problem.
 Now, get back to the question, right?
 Now, here we have, now, in this case, right, we have more than two books, right?
 I think we have four books, is that right?
 Four books.
 Four.
 Four.
 Because, okay, this is multiple comparison, right?
 We compare, even though I went on from two, right?
 But there's only four books here, right?
 You should use four books instead of two books, right?
 If someone two books, only one person, right?
 But you want to do more than two comparisons, right?
 You do the A and B, right?
 In fact, there's six possible comparisons.
 I'll give you two, right?
 So you should have four books, not two.
 I'm sorry.
 Oh, there we go, there we go.
 I thought my hand had that color.
 Yeah, four books here.
 You should get back to the four books.
 There are a bunch of them out there.
 Which might be a little bit confusing.
 Yeah, so in part, you have four books, right?
 Yeah, four books, right?
 So four books, you have four books, right?
 So the four books, right?
 So the four books, right?
 So the four books, this is four, minus one is three.
 Now, remember here, we have...
 Even though for that particular question,
 we want to compare the opinion
 between two seeds, right?
 But in fact, okay, so the whole procedure, right?
 The whole procedure, right?
 You can compare, there's a six different comparisons.
 between a cruiser and a hardware.
 A cruiser and one, one to go, and so on, right?
 There's six different comparison, right?
 I want to ask for two.
 But in here, we should have six comparison, right?
 Of course, I can ask for all six comparison,
 no problem.
 I won't waste my time to ask, right?
 So if you adjust the degree of freedom, right?
 Not just one, two, three, right?
 Four, last one is three, right?
 You will just get the right answer.
 Same formula, the only difference
 between the degree of freedom, the critical value.
 I mean, this is all right, I agree it's all right,
 except one thing, is the critical value.
 Because we want to follow up
 from the chi-square test, right?
 In the part A, you compare four proportions
 of hyperpigments, right?
 So the result indicate, right,
 at least once you have a different opinion
 than the other, right?
 That's why we're going through
 the Moretz-Riol procedure, right?
 Okay, just you can make six possible comparison.
 That only asks for two, right?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, your phone is correct,
 except the critical value.
 Okay.
 So I have four, right?
 Part C.
 Just look at the bottom,
 there's no difference, that's good.
 And we'll get the log-finding rule, right?
 The log-finding rule, what's the log-finding rule?
 What's the log-finding rule?
 Okay, so the first four, right,
 we conduct the board test.
 Okay.
 What is the precipice of the moment?
 And conclusion.
 What is the precipice of the moment?
 What is the precipice of the moment?
 It's the precipice of the moment.
 Now, show me the precipice,
 you got it?
 And then we'll go to you.
 Okay.
 Yeah, no, no, no, but I want to know,
 now you'll do the board test, right?
 You'll pass with the model,
 it's a little bit useful, right?
 It means, I want to see whether
 the angle is a significant projection
 of the moment, of the long-term moment,
 or I want to see whether the angle of time
 of the moment is something that
 I can relate to the moment, right?
 That means I need to have you pass on it.
 Pass the precipice, if you think you got it right,
 and then see if it's possible.
 Oh, we'll do it.
 So that looks like, okay, lots of time,
 lots of time, okay?
 All right, let's try it again.
 I'll be back, okay?
 I'll be back in 10 minutes, okay?
 I'll be back, okay?
 Don't worry, I'll be happy.
 Let you enjoy the assignment, right?
 Now, okay, for both of you, right?
 You have to show me the test statistic
 and P-value and conclusion, that's all, right?
 Remember, you want to do the testing, right?
 On that question, right?
 You want to test whether the annual income
 is a significant predictor of the probability
 of low defaulting, right?
 Or the annual salary is significantly related
 to the probability, right?
 Therefore, you test the statistic, P-value,
 final conclusion.
 Makes sense to you.
 Hmm.
 Okay.
 Oh, okay, so this is a good one, right?
 It's good.
 It's a good one, right?
 It's good.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay.
 Oh, okay.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay.
 Hello.
 Okay.
 Now, in R, now, okay, okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Do you want some more?
 Sure?
 Thank you.
 Is it 1.2?
 1.2.
 1.8.
 Be specific.
 0.6.
 How many zero?
 Six.
 You sure?
 If you're wrong, we'll get one more question.
 Eight.
 Six.
 You're sure, right?
 Write it down here.
 1.8 is eight, I know six.
 1.8 is six, I think it's six here.
 And by the way, 1.2, 1.6 is two.
 Okay, question is, is that 1.1?
 Six.
 Okay, that's what I wanted to know, okay.
 That's right.
 Okay, this is the whole test, right?
 Yeah, the whole test.
 So, is it concluded?
 That we do not need to take another part of it.
 Okay.
 So, that's the question that we have.
 We need to take part of it.
 Okay.
 Maybe a larger part?
 No, the other one.
 Like, what's your test?
 That's a system.
 Let's take between that one.
 You go look at this.
 That's the entity of one of them.
 What is that?
 What is this one?
 That's right, so.
 Is that the evolution?
 That's the sort of one question.
 So, what is the evolution?
 Think about it.
 Think about it.
 Think of the evolution.
 Think of the evolution.
 Think about this.
 Is that evolution?
 Yeah.
 That's a big one.
 Yeah, that's a big one.
 Remember, evolution, right?
 This is a lot later, right?
 So, I'm going to show you this.
 You have the maximizer at the edge, right?
 And then, this is the right?
 There's the log as well.
 Do you see the value?
 Do you see the value?
 Yeah.
 We did it in time.
 That's the log of the evolution.
 Anyway.
 Is your name, this is your name, right?
 Also, let me show you.
 I'm like the king.
 That's my name.
 So, we can say this is my person.
 Yeah.
 That person.
 The income is significant.
 It's not one side.
 It's inside.
 It's inside.
 It's unknown.
 What has to do with it?
 What has to do with it?
 What do you want?
 What's it?
 Subject.
 It exists in the subject.
 So, I'm going to say it exists in the subject.
 It's in the subject.
 Anyway, what's the product?
 What's the output?
 What's the output?
 What's the output?
 What's the code?
 What's the output?
 The what?
 The output.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Questions?
 Okay.
 Okay.
 That's one.
 Alright.
 Alright.
 Good.
 Which was your name first?
 Which was your name first?
 You haven't heard that in the previous class?
 You haven't yet, no?
 Also, you've not talked yet in the starting class, have you?
 We'll begin with you with a question.
 Never?
 Alright, thank you very much, okay.
 What was your name?
 Your name, right?
