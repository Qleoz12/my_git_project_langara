 1 minus p, 1 minus p, 1 minus p. So far, so good.
 How many 1 minus p? It's n minus x, 1 minus p, right?
 Top-getter becomes 1 minus p to the power of n minus x.
 So this is the property of producing our data.
 x, people use iPhone, and n minus x, people do not use iPhone. So far, so good.
 As you can see, this is the function of p.
 This expression is written in terms of p.
 So we can treat this function as this function called likelihood function.
 From p to 1x to prime 1 minus p to power of n minus x.
 For given p, I can get the property of producing our data.
 As I said, p is unknown.
 How can I estimate the p based on the sample data?
 We have to find the most reasonable value of p based on the sample data.
 We have to find the most reasonable value of p based on the sample data.
 And how can I find the most reasonable value of p?
 We need the value we are looking for.
 We are looking for p such that the likelihood is maximum.
 We are looking for the value of p that maximizes the probability of producing our data.
 That should be the most reasonable value.
 We are looking for the value of p that maximizes the likelihood of producing our data.
 How can I find this value?
 Hopefully you understand some calculus.
 The trick is that I have to take the derivative.
 This function should have a max.
 You can grab this function.
 The function looks something like that.
 p is always between 0 and 1.
 The function should look something like that.
 This is the value we are looking for.
 This value maximizes the likelihood function.
 At the maximum, you put a tangent line here.
 The slope is 0.
 Our job is to find the derivative of this function and then set it to be 0.
 Does that make sense to you?
 How can we effectively find the derivative?
 It's an easy way to find the derivative.
 We can use the product rule.
 There are many rules to do that.
 The easiest way is to take the logarithm of this function.
 Take the logarithm.
 The logarithm of the likelihood function is called the log likelihood.
 You know by L of p.
 So it's good.
 We want to find the value of p that maximizes the likelihood function.
 To do that, we have to find the derivative of the likelihood function and then set it to be 0.
 To make the algebra simple,
 we can take the logarithm of the function to the log.
 What are we doing with the log?
 I can bring down all the power inside the log.
 The other thing is, I'm going to show you a little calculus.
 If y is given by log of some function of x,
 the derivative is given by y over f of x times f prime of x.
 Does that make sense to you?
 So we can easily find the derivative of this function.
 Does that make sense to you?
 And the nice thing is,
 this action does not affect the value of p that maximizes the likelihood function.
 We still get the same value that maximizes the likelihood function.
 Is that clear?
 Also, the likelihood function has a nice property.
 We're going to cover this today.
 That's what I want to do.
 You can simplify this function.
 The log of the likelihood function
 will give you capital term.
 If you don't know algebra, that's okay. I'll give you the result.
 It's x times log of p plus n minus x times log of 1 minus p.
 I don't want to show you all the detail algebra.
 That is the log likelihood function.
 As I said, we bring down the power from p beside log.
 So it's easy for us to take the derivative. Does that make sense to you?
 So now, the next step is to take the derivative of a function.
 We can just take the derivative of log likelihood.
 So the log likelihood is given by
 x over p minus n minus x over 1 minus p.
 Again, I won't show you all the detail algebra.
 I'll let you know about that.
 As I said, this is an important point, right?
 I don't want to ask you to take the derivative during the midterm.
 Don't worry. I'll be happy.
 But I won't give you the result, right?
 We'll get something like this.
 x times n times p over n of p times log of p.
 And now we can set it to be zero, right?
 Set the derivative to be zero.
 Why I won't do that? As I said, right?
 When you set the derivative of the log likelihood function,
 it's important to make the derivative of the log likelihood function to be zero.
 Makes sense to you, right?
 The same as the log likelihood function is zero.
 Why does it have to be zero, right?
 We can solve this function.
 Zero equals to x times n times p over p times log of p, right?
 So that's in pi.
 x equals to x over p e to the n, right?
 That's in pi, right?
 p equals to x over n.
 And this is the sample proportion.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Therefore, the p we are looking for,
 that maximize the likelihood function given by
 x over n, which is the sample proportion.
 So far so good.
 Now, as I said, right?
 My expectations are, one, understand the central concept of maximum likelihood estimation, right?
 We're looking for the value of p that maximize the likelihood function,
 maximize the probability of producing our data, okay?
 Second, is formally the likelihood function using basic probability rule.
 That's it.
 That's all, okay?
 I don't expect you know algebra,
 but you should know some basic algebra, okay?
 Very basic, okay?
 I don't expect you know derivative.
 Leave it, okay?
 Does that sound new?
 Any questions so far?
 Are we going to try the assignment?
 Problem two?
 Is that problem two, right?
 Problem three?
 I'll let you work for today, okay?
 If you have any questions, you can ask me, right?
 Alright, that's what I did last day.
 So far so good.
 Okay, we're going to introduce maximum,
 sorry, maximum likelihood test.
 Oh, sorry, likelihood ratio test, sorry.
 Alright, today we're going to talk about likelihood ratio test.
 Does that make sense?
 Alright, in this lecture, you will learn how to use the likelihood function
 to test a claim about a proportion.
 Alright, let's begin the topic with an example.
 A random sample type of student is selected from a college, say like there.
 60 of them use iPhones.
 And we want to use the sample data to determine
 whether the proportion of all students who use an iPhone is different from 50%.
 Is that like 100 people?
 Alright, 100 people.
 60 of them use iPhones, is that right?
 So the proportion of students we sample who use iPhones is 60%, is that right?
 Now, 60% is clearly different from 50%, is that right?
 Okay, I understand.
 Okay, final problem.
 However, this is not my concern.
 Because we only observe this in a sample.
 If I repeat the study again, again and again with different random samples,
 it may not happen, is that right?
 So we, my concern is the whole population.
 I want to know, in the population of all students,
 the proportion of all students who use an iPhone is different from 50%, is that right?
 Now, the sample gives us a clue.
 It might happen in the population.
 That's why one has this claim.
 Whether the proportion of all people who use an iPhone is different from 50%.
 Alright, let's follow the hypothesis.
 First, I want to say the alternative hypothesis.
 Now, recall, the alternative hypothesis is the claim we are going to test.
 And what's the claim?
 We test the proportion of all students who use an iPhone is different from 50%, right?
 So we say P does not equal to 0.5.
 So P is the proportion of all students who use an iPhone, alright?
 Now, forget about the null hypothesis.
 The null hypothesis always stick with equal sign.
 Same as before, right?
 Okay, we say P equal to 0.5, it means exactly, exactly,
 50% of all students use an iPhone under the null hypothesis.
 That was good? Not too bad, okay.
 Now, to perform the test,
 we need to calculate how likely your observed data is under both hypotheses, okay?
 Then we compare two likelihoods using a ratio.
 So the ratio is defined as the likelihood under the null hypothesis
 divided by the maximum likelihood under the alternative hypothesis.
 Okay, we'll use the ratio.
 Now, the likelihood ratio test asks the following question.
 Does the null hypothesis make your observed data near as likely to occur
 as the maximum likelihood under the alternative hypothesis?
 Okay, now, we get back to the likelihood function, right?
 Now, as I said, we're looking for the value of P that maximize the likelihood function, is that right?
 Based on the sample data.
 We call the value that maximize the likelihood function is the sample proportion, is that right?
 Okay, so when P equals to the sample proportion, it will maximize the likelihood.
 It will maximize the probability of producing our data, is that right?
 Okay, now under the null hypothesis, we believe the proportion is 0.5, is that right?
 Now, 0.5 obviously is not the value that maximize the likelihood function, is that right?
 It's not the one that maximize the probability of producing our data.
 It should be close, is that what I'm saying, right?
 If the null hypothesis is true, okay, that P is truly 0.5, okay?
 It should make the probability of producing our data close at the maximum likelihood.
 Even though it's not the max, but should be close to max, is that right?
 So that is the idea behind the likelihood visual test.
 So here's a question.
 Does the null hypothesis make your observed data near as likelihood curve at maximum likelihood?
 That's the key concept, right?
 If the null is true, okay, it should be very close, okay?
 So here's a property of a likelihood ratio.
 The likelihood ratio is always less than or equal to 1.
 Why?
 Remember, the ratio is defined as the likelihood under the null hypothesis
 divided by the maximum likelihood.
 Divided by maximum, right?
 That means the number on the top must be less than the number at the bottom, is that right?
 You take a number divided by maximum.
 This number has to be less than 1. Does this make sense to you?
 Because the max likelihood under the alternative hypothesis is always greater or equal to the likelihood under the null hypothesis.
 Let me just write it up for you right here.
 So, the max likelihood
 under H8 must be greater than any likelihood under H1.
 That's why it's called max, right?
 Here for the ratio, equal to likelihood under H0 divided by the max likelihood under H8 must be less than 1.
 So that's good, or equal to, you can say, right?
 Does it make sense to you?
 Now, if the null hypothesis is true,
 if the null hypothesis is true, it will make the observed data near as likely as the maximum likelihood under the alternative.
 Therefore, the ratio will be closer to 1.
 It makes sense to you, right?
 The null hypothesis makes the observed data near as likely as the maximum likelihood.
 So if the value of P under the null hypothesis makes the likelihood as closer to the maximum likelihood,
 the ratio should be closer to 1. Does this make sense to you?
 This indicates that the observed data are consistent with the null hypothesis.
 Therefore, we should not reject the null hypothesis.
 So that's good.
 Alright, on the other hand,
 if the null hypothesis does not make the observed data near as likely as the maximum likelihood,
 so that's a big gap between two likelihoods, right?
 R is close to 0.
 That's for example, right?
 Suppose you believe the proportion of all students who use an iPhone is 0.1.
 For example, 0.1, let's say that, right?
 But in our data, we observe 0.6. Come on, it's a big difference, right?
 So in this case, the null hypothesis does not make our observed data as near as likely as the maximum likelihood.
 So the ratio should be really small.
 How small? Close to 0.
 So what should we do?
 So this indicates the observed data are not consistent with the null hypothesis.
 Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
 Now, in summary, as the likelihood ratio gets closer to 0,
 the evidence against the null hypothesis becomes stronger.
 Okay?
 As the ratio gets closer to 0, the stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Yeah? Good problem?
 Now, don't let you know.
 In the future, we will always use the likelihood ratio test.
 Okay?
 That's why you need to understand the concept, right, you know?
 Right.
 Now, let's perform the likelihood ratio test.
 Now, the likelihood ratio test is denoted by LRT.
 LRT, okay?
 L stands for likelihood, R stands for ratio, T stands for test.
 Instead of likelihood well-being.
 Whatever, right, you know, it's different, okay?
 LRT, L stands for likelihood, R stands for ratio, T stands for test.
 Okay?
 It's not light well-being training, okay?
 It's a different concept, right?
 You know, in calculus, right, we have a light well-being, right, you know?
 Okay?
 Difference.
 It's also important.
 There are a couple of ones, right?
 Okay?
 All right.
 All right.
 From the last lecture, we learned the likelihood function of the unknown population proportion is given by this function.
 Okay?
 It's a constant times P to the power of X times 1 minus P to the power of M minus X.
 All right?
 For the case I just showed you, the constant is 1.
 But in some cases, the constant is not 1.
 Don't worry.
 Be happy.
 The constant has made no contribution to the ratio test.
 Don't let it come, okay?
 When you calculate the likelihood ratio, the constant will be gone.
 So the constant has no role, okay?
 Make no contribution to statistical inference.
 So don't worry.
 Be happy.
 You can drop out the constant.
 That's not really matter.
 All right.
 Now in the expression, now P represents the unknown value of the population proportion.
 In this case, it is the proportion of all students who use an iPhone.
 X represents the number of individuals who fall in the category of interest.
 In this case, this represents the number of students who use an iPhone.
 Finally, N. N represents the sample size.
 Does this make sense?
 All good?
 Now in this example, we select a sample of 100 students.
 And 60 of them use iPhone, right?
 Okay, so let's formulate the lemma function.
 So L of P, right?
 Is given by P12X times 1 not P12M minus A.
 Now, I don't put a constant here.
 It's not really important anyway, okay?
 It's going to cancel out.
 They did all right, not bad deal, okay?
 In this case, N is 100, right?
 We select 100 people and 60 of them use iPhone.
 So the lemma function becomes P to the power of 60.
 Now, X is 60, right?
 Okay.
 And N is 100.
 So far so good.
 So now, we're putting all the numbers into the lemma function.
 So we get P12X times 1 not P to the power of 100 minus 60.
 That is P12X times 1 not P to the power of 100 minus 60 is 40.
 That means other 40 people do not use an iPhone.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Okay.
 Now, let's move on.
 Under the null hypothesis,
 under the null hypothesis, right?
 P is 0.5.
 This is the hypothesis proportion, is that right?
 Okay.
 So we have to plug in 0.5 into the likelihood function
 and get the likelihood value.
 Does it make sense?
 So under the null hypothesis, P is 0.5.
 So to calculate the likelihood at P equal to 0.5,
 that is 0.5 to the power of 60 times 1 not 0.5 to the power of 40.
 Now, you can zoom in a little bit, right?
 0.560 is also 0.5, right?
 1 not 0.5 is 0.5, right?
 So 0.560, 0.1 to the power of 40 together become 1.
 It's 0.5 to the power of what number?
 0.5.
 Alright, good, that's it.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Alright.
 Can I move on?
 Alright, under the alternative hypothesis,
 P does not, yes?
 Do you put 0.4 as 40?
 Oh, this would be 40, not 0.4, right?
 Not 40, right?
 Alright, good, you passed my test.
 I detest you.
 Okay, thank you very much.
 May I move on?
 Okay, now under the alternative hypothesis,
 P does not equal 0.5, right?
 So that means there are many possible choices for P.
 So P can be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, right?
 Whatever you want.
 But we need to pick the one,
 pick the value of P that maximizes the likelihood function, is that right?
 And this value is defined by the sample proportion, is that right?
 Alright, the value of P that maximizes the likelihood function
 is the sample proportion, right?
 P bar.
 In this case, the sample proportion is defined by 60 over 100.
 Remember, we sample hundreds of people, right?
 And 60 of them use iPhone,
 so the sample proportion is 60 over 100, which is 0.6.
 So we put 0.6 into the likelihood function.
 So that's good now, right?
 Alright, so under the alternative hypothesis,
 P is 0.6.
 It's given by the sample proportion, right?
 So the likelihood function at 0.6 is given by 0.6 to the power of 60
 times 1 minus 0.6 to the power of 40.
 Now let's do the math here.
 The first one is 0.6 to the power of 60, right?
 Second time is 0.4, right?
 It's 0.4 to the power of 40.
 That's all you can simplify. That's it.
 Does this make sense to you?
 Now for now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio, okay?
 The likelihood ratio, R, is given by the likelihood.
 The likelihood under H2O divided by the max likelihood under HK, right?
 Now, the likelihood under the null hypothesis is given by 0.5 to the power of 100, is that right?
 And the max likelihood under the alternative is given by 0.6 to the power of 60 times 40 to the power of 0.4.
 So far so good.
 Alright, let's simplify.
 We'll get the number, right?
 Now, don't let you know.
 The number is approximately...
 What's that?
 The null hypothesis, right?
 You wrote this form up, you're right.
 You know you all passed my test, right?
 Oh, okay.
 Let's do that here, right?
 Finally, we got 0.133 something.
 1, 3, 3.
 5, 1, 5, 5.
 1, 3, 7, something like that, right?
 Wow, did you see that?
 This number is pretty close to 0.
 Did you see that?
 But I just said, you know, as the likelihood ratio gets closer to 0, stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, right?
 So this in the case, there should be strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
 Does this make sense?
 So in this case, right, based on the calculation, we can say the observed data, which is 60 people use Eiffel.
 And of all the people who use Eiffel, are not consistent with the null hypothesis, right?
 That provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, okay?
 Now, to determine how strong this evidence, how strong the evidence is, we need to calculate the p-value.
 Remember, when you perform any hypothesis test, when you get a p-value, right?
 Smaller p-value, stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
 But this rule is always true, always true in any hypothesis test.
 Same in likelihood ratio test.
 So how can you get a p-value from the likelihood ratio test?
 Now, to calculate the p-value of the likelihood ratio test,
 First, we need to convert the likelihood ratio R into a chi-square statistic.
 Now, in this course, you always do chi-square statistic, not just this example.
 But in many examples, in many test procedures you learn in the future, it's always chi-square statistic.
 So in this course, you deal with two different test statistics.
 What is C-statistic?
 The other one is chi-square, no any other.
 So we have to convert the likelihood ratio R into a chi-square test statistic.
 Now, this chi-square test statistic is also called DEVIANCE.
 But it's called chi-square statistic.
 I think you're more familiar with chi-square statistic, right?
 Now, how can you do that?
 We have to use the transformation.
 We take the log of the likelihood ratio and then times negative 2.
 Now, don't ask me why I won't do that, okay?
 There's reason for that.
 There's a math reason behind it, okay?
 That I don't want to waste my time explaining, okay?
 So you have to convert the likelihood ratio R to chi-square statistic, okay?
 First, we take the logarithm of the ratio and then times negative 2.
 That's it.
 Now, for our north sample, the chi-square statistic D follows a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
 That means we can calculate the p-value from the chi-square distribution.
 Now, I think we talked about chi-square distribution before, right?
 In the previous lecture, right?
 When you compare more than two proportions, right?
 The p-value is the area under chi-square distribution, okay?
 The area is on the right side of the chi-square statistic, okay?
 This is the p-value, right?
 The p-value is the area of the right tail bounded by the chi-square statistic.
 Sounds good?
 Alright, so let's get the p-value in our case that we call...
 This is the likelihood ratio, okay?
 It's defined by 0.5 to the power of hundreds divided by 0.6 to the power of 60 times 0.4 to the power of 40, okay?
 We take the log of this ratio...
 The log of this ratio...
 Now, we use Ln.
 Let's do a log, right?
 I'll give you a natural log, by the way.
 You know, on your calculator, right?
 There's a button called Ln.
 Ln, right?
 We take the log of this ratio and then times negative 2, right?
 Now, be careful, right?
 This is a match of negative 2 that give...
 That make...
 This quantity follow our chi-square distribution.
 Without negative 2, we cannot get the distribution to let you know, right?
 This is a match of negative 2, okay?
 So it's all 4.027103.
 Okay, with the calculation?
 Are you okay with logarithm?
 Why is it logarithm?
 Just put it on the calculator, right?
 It's a long key, right?
 And then log of this ratio...
 All right, now we're going to calculate the p-value, right?
 Now, to calculate the p-area under chi-square distribution...
 Okay?
 We need software.
 Okay, this is not an easy math problem.
 Calculate the area under chi-square distribution is not an easy job.
 It's a difficult job in math, okay?
 It's required a large computer power.
 But in this state, there's no nothing, right?
 You won't be happy, but long time ago, right?
 It's challenging.
 This is really challenging, okay?
 Anyway, in this state, we can ask your best friend to do it for you.
 Who's your best friend?
 R, right? No, I should call AI.
 You're going to use AI to code, right, and then copy the R, right, you know?
 By the way, on the resume, don't say, I don't R.
 That's useless.
 You say, oh, I need this AI to do R programming, to do Python programming.
 Doesn't make sense, right, you know?
 But you still need R in this state, okay?
 So let's program this in R.
 First, I calculate the likelihood ratio.
 And get the chi-square statistic.
 By taking negative 2 times log random of the ratio.
 Now, in R, we don't call log.
 In R, we don't call ln, okay?
 In R, we don't use ln.
 We use log, L-O-G.
 Does that make sense?
 So L-O-G is seen as ln in R.
 But of course, on the calculator, it's not true, okay?
 On the calculator, we have to find the T, ln, okay?
 Right now, let's calculate the area under chi-square distribution.
 In R, there is a function called p chi-square.
 p stands for probability.
 And chi-square stands for chi-square distribution.
 So p chi-square.
 So p stands for probability.
 This stands for chi-square distribution.
 Now, this function calculates the area of the left tail.
 Now, left tail, be careful, okay?
 So let me draw a picture, right?
 This is a chi-square distribution, right?
 This is the p-value.
 It's the area on the right, right?
 This is the chi-square value.
 What's the chi-square value here?
 I don't know. It's 4.27, right?
 Now, the p chi-square calculates the area on the left of these numbers.
 So p chi-square calculates the area on the left side.
 So what's so good?
 Now, this function requires two inputs.
 First, it's the chi-square value.
 It's 4.27.
 The other one is the degree of freedom.
 The degree of freedom is always 1 in this case.
 You're testing one parameter.
 So the degree of freedom is 1, okay?
 Later on, when you test multiple parameters,
 the degree of freedom is not just 1, okay?
 Just like when you compare more than two proportions, right?
 The degree of freedom is however proportion being compared minus 1, okay?
 So you have to pay attention.
 When you get the area on the left tail,
 you subtract from 1, then you get an EIU.
 Does this make sense to you?
 The EIU is really small, but not really small, right?
 It's 0.047747.
 That's an EIU.
 And I said, smaller EIU, stronger evidence against the law of hypothesis.
 Is that a small EIU?
 Well, you have to compare with the significant level, right?
 Okay.
 So compared to 0.05, it is small.
 Therefore, the evidence is strong enough to reject the law of hypothesis.
 At a 5% significant level,
 the sample data will find sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis, okay?
 Which is we can conclude, right?
 Well, again, null hypothesis, right?
 Therefore, we can reject null hypothesis and support alternative, right?
 That's the proportion of all students who use an iPhone is different from 50%.
 That's it.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Now, one thing to keep in mind,
 the likelihood ratio test cannot test the direction of the proportion.
 It cannot test whether P is bigger than or less than 0.5.
 Only different from 0.5.
 No direction is specified, okay?
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, no problem.
 All right, may I move on?
 Okay, I better give you a point on the assignment, right?
 Just want to finish up?
 Is it okay?
 Is there going to be a problem?
 All right, condition for a valid likelihood ratio test of a population proportion.
 Now, I mentioned before, right,
 to get these tests is only valid when you have a lower sample, a large sample.
 But how large is enough?
 Now, for the likelihood ratio test of a population proportion,
 it is recommended that the expected number of individuals who fall into the category of interest
 and the expected number of individuals who do not fall into the category of interest
 are both at least 5 in a sample.
 By the way, even though 5 is a pretty small number, right?
 But we still get more and more numbers, okay?
 Now, 5 is fairly okay.
 Just say fairly okay, right?
 If the true proportion is something close to 0 or close to 1, right?
 We're going to have a big problem, okay?
 We need more and more.
 We need a bigger, bigger sample size to get a balanced result.
 Okay?
 So 5 is barely minimum, okay?
 You should get maybe 15 or 20, right?
 That's the more safer.
 Does this make sense to you?
 All right, in our example, okay,
 we want to test whether 50% of all students use iPhones, is that right?
 Right?
 Under the null hypothesis, we expect that under the null hypothesis, okay,
 if the null hypothesis is true,
 we expect exactly 50% of all students use iPhones, is that right?
 Now, we pick a sample of 100 students.
 Therefore, we expect 50% of 100 students
 will use an iPhone.
 So what is 50% of 100?
 Which is 50, right?
 We expect 50 students in a sample
 who use an iPhone, okay?
 The next question is,
 what is the expected number of students who do not use an iPhone?
 Well, we can calculate this one.
 We can take the total, 100, 100 students, right?
 Minus the expected number of students who use an iPhone.
 Minus 50 is also 50, right?
 Now, both numbers are bigger than 5.
 Therefore, the sample is sufficiently large.
 The conclusion,
 total from the likelihood ratio test should be valid,
 should be correct,
 and can be plus.
 So what should we do?
 Okay.
 All right, a couple of things, okay?
 Now, we call,
 we also learn how to test
 our population proportion using CTAS, is that right?
 We learned that before, right?
 In the previous class, also in our review class, right?
 Well, let's compare the results
 with the one sample CTAS.
 Okay, now, to run the CTAS,
 we have to calculate the C statistic, is that right?
 The C statistic is given by
 the sample proportion
 minus the population proportion
 under the null hypothesis,
 divided by square root of
 the population proportion
 times 1 minus the population proportion
 over the sample size n.
 Remember this expression here?
 Now, in this case, the sample proportion is 0.6.
 The population proportion under the null hypothesis is 0.5.
 We'll put the number into the formula,
 I got 2, I got 2, okay?
 Now, let's calculate the P-value in this case.
 Now, a little bit careful this time.
 We are testing the proportion is different from 0.5, right?
 Different from 0.5 has two directions.
 Could be P greater than 0.5,
 or P less than 0.5.
 So there are two different cases, right?
 Therefore, the P-value is a total area
 of the left tail and the right tail.
 Are you okay with that?
 Now, the left tail divided by negative 2.
 It basically said the proportion we observe in the sample
 can be below the population proportion
 by two standard deviations.
 Is that okay?
 So the proportion we observe in the sample
 can be lower than the population proportion
 on the under actual by two standard deviations.
 You know, right?
 On the right side, the cut point is given by 2,
 all the parts of it.
 Let's say the proportion we observe in the sample
 can be higher than the population proportion
 by two standard deviations.
 So there are two directions, right?
 And how do we get the P-value?
 When the C-square is 2,
 sorry, negative 2, right?
 The area of the left tail is 0.228.
 When the C-square is plus 2,
 the area of the right tail is also 0.0228.
 Add together, or times 2,
 is given by 0.0456.
 0.0456.
 Any questions so far?
 I hope you learned that before, right?
 Yeah?
 You should learn it in the first course.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 Also an overall review, right?
 All right, now let's compare both P-value.
 Now, if we run the radical ratio test,
 the P-value was 0.0448.
 If you run the Z-test,
 the P-value was 0.0456.
 They are pretty close, is that right?
 They are very close, by the way.
 Okay, this indicates a strong agreement
 between the line-foot ratio test and the Z-test.
 The question is why?
 Why both tests have the similar P-value?
 In fact, they are all the same, is that right?
 Now, this is just a math, okay?
 Now, in fact, the chi-square statistic,
 used in the line-foot ratio test,
 can be approximate by this expression here.
 Now, I don't want to show you the math here, okay?
 We can prove that.
 Two times long of the line-foot ratio
 can be approximate by square of this quantity.
 Now, this quantity looks like the chi-square statistic
 under the Z-test, is that right?
 Now, look at this expression here.
 Now, this quantity is not the chi-square statistic
 under the Z-test, but they are pretty similar.
 Do you guys see that?
 What is the difference between these two expressions?
 What is the difference between the two expressions?
 They're similar, you're right.
 But what's the difference?
 What's the difference?
 What's the difference?
 The denominator, you're right.
 Remember, when you want the Z-test, right?
 The Z-statistic uses the population proportion
 under the null hypothesis in the denominator, is that right?
 In the line-foot ratio test, okay?
 The denominator uses P bar as a sample proportion.
 It's the one we get from the sample, is that right?
 Now, these two expressions, of course, are different, right?
 But they follow the same distribution.
 They both follow the null distribution, okay?
 As a result, the line-foot ratio test and the Z-test
 produce a very similar P value.
 That's the reason, okay?
 Alright, that's about line-foot ratio test.
 Any question about that?
 Okay.
 Now, take a break, okay?
 Come back, we're going to do the assignment.
 Now, remember our assignment three, right?
 Now, in the class, I want you to complete
 problem two and problem three.
 Basically all the assignments.
 Okay, actually, problem one,
 so we made it part of the problem one, right?
 Problem two, alright?
 And problem three, basically all the assignments, okay?
 Okay, if you want to do one last question,
 sure, go ahead, okay?
 And see how it goes.
 Take a break, and then continue to work on the assignment.
 Now, by the end of the class,
 I expect you can finish problem one.
 Remember, in the previous class, right?
 We finished the first half of the problem one, right?
 I give you the answer key, price, pay, right?
 In the remaining part, you have to conduct
 likelihood ratio test, alright?
 Finish this one.
 Then I wish you have time to do the second problem, right?
 Let's see how it goes.
 Oh, by the way, I remember, I gave you a handout, right?
 Long time ago, right?
 It's about testing a population proportion.
 I'll just show you.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Here's the handout I gave you last time.
 I remember.
 Long time ago, right?
 We'll have all the formula for likelihood function,
 likelihood ratio test,
 likelihood ratio, things like that, right?
 This is your reference.
 You can use that for the big job, particularly.
 Hopefully, you still have it, right?

 We are ready to do this first, the surf.
 So what's the problem?
 We are ready to do this one.
 Yeah, we did part A and part D, we're done.
 We've done part A and part D.
 We did it last time.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Okay, okay.
 So we have to do part E, right?
 That's what we covered today.
 Okay.
 Have you read the solution I posted online?
 No, I didn't see it.
 No, I posted it on Brightspace.
 Have you checked it?
 No, I didn't see it on Brightspace.
 Check it now.
 Great.
 Go to course announcement.
 What?
 Course one.
 It's right here.
 Okay.
 What was the problem here?
 No, there's no problem.
 Just I'm still understanding this.
 Okay.
 Shoot this one more, okay?
