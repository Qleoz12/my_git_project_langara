 I think you are finished, right?
 Or do you want me to go over this problem?
 So, okay, okay.
 As I said, right, in this case, we know all people use iPhone and one does not use.
 But which one uses iPhone? Which one does not use iPhone? I don't know.
 That's why we use all possible cases and get the probability.
 In the first case, the first four people use iPhone, is that right?
 So the probability that the first four people use iPhone is given by P times P times P times P, right?
 The last person does not use, right? It will be 1 minus P.
 And then time together, right?
 So what's so good?
 So it's given by P power 4 times 1 minus P.
 Does it make sense to you?
 Alright, in the second case, the first three person use iPhone.
 I use back cover, right? I put a check mark here, okay?
 Me, they use iPhone.
 Use iPhone, okay?
 And the last person also use iPhone.
 Who does not use iPhone?
 Which is the fourth person, is that okay?
 Are you caused to denote the person that does not use iPhone?
 Does it make sense?
 And what's the probability?
 The probability that the first person use iPhone is P, is that right?
 Second person also P.
 Third person also P.
 The fourth person is 1 minus P, right?
 The last person, the probability is iPhone is P, right?
 And then time together, we have 1, 2, 3, 4.
 Time 1 minus P.
 So what's so good?
 In the next case, the first person, second person,
 the fourth person, and the third person use iPhone.
 And the third one does not use it.
 And what's the probability for this case?
 Again, it's P times P times 1 minus P
 times P times P, which is P power of 4, times 1 minus P.
 Does that make sense?
 In the next case, the first person, the third person,
 the fourth, the fifth use iPhone.
 And the second does not use.
 What's the probability for this case?
 P times 1 minus P times P times P and times P equal to P power of 4 times 1 minus P.
 So far so good.
 Okay, look at the fifth case.
 Who does not use iPhone?
 First one, good.
 And then the other four use iPhone, right?
 What's the probability?
 It's given by 1 minus P times P times P and times P.
 That is P power of 4 again, times 1 minus P.
 So far so good.
 Do you have any questions?
 Now, we haven't done yet.
 Now, we only have the probability of each case, is that right?
 How can I combine together?
 Should I times again or add this time?
 Now, there are five different cases in which four people use iPhone
 and one does not use it, is that right?
 So case 1, or case 2, or case 3, or case 4.
 When you see OR, you add up.
 We're going to add all the probability, right?
 So what's the sum?
 Now, we add the same probability, is that right?
 Five times.
 So this is 5 times P power of 4 times 1 minus P power of 1.
 And that is the probability of producing our data.
 Is that right?
 In case 3, four use iPhone and one does not use it.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Now, this is a function of P, right?
 That is the likelihood function.
 So P at 5 times P to power of 4 times 1 minus P.
 So far so good.
 Now, this time, the likelihood function is a little bit different from previous, right?
 When the constant multiplies P to power of something, right?
 But the constant should not affect the location of maximum.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Anyway, now from here, we can get the log likelihood function.
 So far so good.
 So now what I want to do, I want to find the value of P that maximize the likelihood function.
 Is that clear?
 To do that, I need to take derivative, right?
 But before I do that, I want to make the math easier.
 How?
 Convert to log likelihood.
 Is that okay?
 Now I want to convert the log likelihood function.
 So the log likelihood function is given by log of the likelihood function.
 Is that okay?
 That is log of 5 times P to power of 4 times 1 minus P.
 Is that okay?
 Now, this is the product of three terms.
 I can break it down into log of 5 plus log of P to power of 4 plus log of 1 minus P.
 So far so good.
 Now this term is a constant.
 Who cares?
 But this term we can further simplify, right?
 The power can bring it down beside the log, is that right?
 So we have log of 5 plus 4 times log of P plus log of 1 minus P.
 So far so good?
 Is she okay?
 Alright, what next?
 Now one way of taking the log likelihood function is a time to take derivative.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Can you see it?
 Can you erase?
 Where did I put it?
 Okay.
 Which one?
 Anyway, just take the derivative, right?
 So the derivative of the function.
 First of all, I have to take the derivative of constant, right?
 And then take the derivative of 4 times the derivative of long P.
 Is that right?
 Plus the derivative of long of 1 minus P.
 Procline here, right?
 Now the derivative of constant is just 0, is that right?
 Constant.
 This is 0, right?
 Now what is the derivative of long of P?
 Remember?
 It's 1 over P.
 Okay, so 4 times log of P.
 Next term.
 What is the derivative of long of 1 minus P?
 It's 1 over 1 minus P, right?
 Because with the negative sign, beside P, right?
 We have negative 1 in the front.
 Make sense?
 So all together become 4 over P minus 1 over 1 minus P.
 That is the derivative.
 Of the line rule function.
 Is that right?
 I mean, log line rule function.
 Any questions so far?
 Now we have to set the derivative to 0, right?
 And then solve for P.
 Does that make sense?
 Then we know the locate the value of P that maximize the line rule function.
 Okay, you listen.
 Alright, so what's P far, right?
 Okay, not P far.
 Let me do this, okay?
 So let's solve P, right?
 Okay.
 P far such that the derivative of the line rule is 0.
 So now we're going to solve for P far, right?
 Okay, as is 4 over P far minus 1 over P far.
 How to solve this function?
 Okay, first of all, we're going to find the denominator, right?
 This time we need 1 minus P far, right?
 This time we need P far, right?
 So we have 4 minus 4 P far, right?
 And that minus 1 P far, right?
 Over P far times 1 minus P far.
 Now, minus 4 P far and 1 P far give you negative 5 P far, right?
 Okay, now to make this one to be 0, it's important to make the denominator to be 0.
 So what's so good?
 Because the denominator never be 0, right?
 So we need 0 equal to 4 minus 5 times P far.
 Therefore P far is, you tell me it's 4 over 5.
 So what's so good?
 Which is point A.
 This is the proportion of people who use iPhone in the sample.
 Is that right?
 And this value maximize the probability of the observed data, right?
 This is the maximum probability of the data we have.
 Is that right?
 Does this make sense to you?
 It's amazing, right?
 No matter how we do, we just get P bar.
 We still get the sample proportion.
 So this is the number.
 Maximize the likelihood function.
 Maximize the probability of producing our data.
 What's your data?
 So like 5 people use iPhone and 1 does not use.
 So that's the most reasonable estimate of P, is that right?
 Because it maximize the probability of producing our data.
 Let me give you a final summary, right?
 I'll let you go on the question, okay?
 Alright, so let me give you a final summary, okay?
 And then I'll let you go on the question.
 You might need 5 minutes.
 Alright, let me give you a general result of the maximum likelihood estimation for a proportion.
 In a population, P times 100% of all individuals fall in the category of interest.
 Let's say 60% of all people use iPhone.
 Suppose we take a random sample of an individual and observe X individual fall into the category of interest.
 And the remaining N minus X individual does not fall into the category of interest.
 The likelihood function that the probability of producing our data, we assume our data with two categories.
 Does that make sense?
 Alright, it's given by a constant times the P to the power of X times one minus P to the power of N minus X.
 This is a general result, right?
 In a function, the data N and X are fixed.
 They are just a constant.
 When the data have been obtained, N and X are just a constant, right?
 For example, you take 5 people, 3 use iPhone, those are the fixed numbers, is that right?
 The variable is P.
 We need to find the P that maximizes the probability of producing our data, right?
 Is that okay?
 So P is the variable.
 By the way, the constants basically have no contribution to the value of P that maximizes the likelihood function.
 You can drop that out if you want. Not a big deal. Does that make sense to you?
 Now in fact, this constant is given by the binomial coefficient.
 If you want on the probability deal, right?
 But this constant pay no role. It's completely useless.
 It doesn't affect the value of P that maximizes the likelihood function.
 But you can include it if you want on the probability deal.
 So the corresponding log likelihood function is given by...
 Now, log of the constant plus X times log of P plus N times minus X times log of 1 minus P.
 The derivative of the log likelihood function is given by X over P minus N minus X over 1 minus P.
 Bring it together. If it's simplified, right?
 It will be X times N minus P over P times 1 minus P. Is that clear?
 That's the general result.
 And clearly, when you set the derivative to be zero, P is equal to X over N. Is that right?
 Therefore, the thiope that maximizes the likelihood function is given by X over N, which is the sample proportion, right?
 This is exactly what we learned before, right? Does this make sense to you?
 That's why we always use the sample proportion to estimate a population proportion. That's the reason behind it.
 Because the sample proportion always maximizes the likelihood function, which is the probability of producing our data.
 Alright, key takeaway.
 The maximum likelihood estimator of a population proportion is the sample proportion.
 This explains why we use sample proportion to estimate or test a population proportion.
 That's it.
 Alright, now I'm not going to give you more content. We'll just stop here.
 Next thing, we're going to show you how to test a population proportion using the likelihood function. Is that clear?
 Now, in the rest of the class, we have lots of time, right?
 I want you to at least finish.
 Problem 1, question A, B, C, D.
 Now, if you have time, you can continue to work on the other part, but we haven't covered it yet.
 Let's deal with maximization test. You'll learn next day.
 You still feel boring? This is out of problem 2, right?
 You can work on problem 2 as well as problem 3 and 4.
 I pose on Bright's face. This is assignment 3.
 You also have work to do.
 Let me show you.
 Under assessment, assignment.
 This is assignment 3. Maximum likelihood estimator.
 Can you give me one?
 You have it? Okay, you will be happy.
 Now, by the end of today's class, you have to complete problem 1, A, B, C, D. That's it.
 Alright? So to me, then you get marked and then you go home.
 If you still have a lot of free time, continue to work on the other problems.
 Lots of problems.
 That's assignment 3, okay?
 Don't do this week, don't worry.
 This is next Friday.
 Have you finished?
 Okay, let me see a little first.
 A, B, C, D.
 You can write on the work file and then set the degree.
 Or you can write on the paper.
 I'm not sure if I can do that.
 Okay, what was the name?
 Problem 1, A, B, C, D.
 Let me see.
 What again?
 Alright, I don't think this is going to work.
 Because A will not take it in one page.
 This number was taken in one page.
 Now, I think note first.
 Why is that together?
 Okay, remember?
 You select Y, R, C, and another N.
 Y, this is the right.
 Do you see N?
 This is almost put in the right.
 So that's why it's not F.
 Okay.
 You're right.
 You're right.
 Absolutely, you're right.
 But the right, you don't need to ask the other way.
 You know who used a macro, who used Y.
 The cause is this one.
 That's the domain.
 In you.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah, almost.
 So now you're right.
 You did a lot of work on it, right?
 A lot of expression, right?
 Yeah, you're right.
 Absolutely.
 One minus, right?
 Yes, not one.
 One minus two over two.
 This is one minus two over two.
 Okay.
 Okay, good.
 And then you take two.
 How many two?
 Anyway, you finished?
 All of it is.
 So in two we have one red.
 And you're right, just right under P, right?
 And then you have to divide together.
 And you get the purpose of like five R's to the right.
 And five pieces to the right.
 So it's going to look like all the properties together.
 Yeah.
 That's why we don't want to multiply.
 Exactly, exactly.
 And then we have to get the P7, 1 minus 5.
 Okay.
 But what about P2 here?
 You say P out, P right?
 Why is P out?
 Remember, for a business student, right?
 Something here.
 For a business student, right?
 There is about P over 2 probability.
 Yeah.
 That's why we have to multiply P by 2.
 Exactly right.
 You make sense?
 Yeah.
 Okay, now for our student, right?
 No, no, no, no.
 This is not that...
 Okay, so you don't need one here right now.
 You don't need the combination, right?
 You don't need this one here.
 You don't want to do that.
 But you don't need that.
 Sometimes you do the whole thing.
 You want to use MacBook, which you don't use MacBook, right?
 So this concept is just one.
 This makes sense, right?
 You don't know, of course, you have to look at all multiple pieces, right?
 So we need the combination.
 But you know who used MacBook, right?
 You know who you don't use MacBook, right?
 Or the concept is just one.
 Does this make sense to you?
 But again, the concept does not affect the value of P, the maximizer, the lightning function.
 You're right, you're right.
 It doesn't make any sense, right?
 That's why you don't need the concept.
 If you want, you don't need the problem.
 Shit.
 It doesn't make any sense.
 It doesn't make any sense.
 It doesn't make any sense.
 What was the packaging?
 You can drop it out right here.
 It doesn't mean that.
 That's right.
 The tricky part is that, you know, the problem of students using MacBook is different between parts and places.
 Let's do that.
 So you have to adjust the P, right?
 Accordingly.
 You want it exactly.
 Does that make sense?
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Don't be here yet.
 But this is not, what's the problem?
 But the first place is to the use of MacBook.
 What's the problem?
 P.
 That's it.
 Okay.
 There.
 Okay.
 Show the problem.
 Okay, remember, we select five art students and five business students.
 Five art students and five business students.
 You see, and what do you want to do?
 That's it.
 We use multiple cases, right?
 Yeah.
 But there's only one case, right?
 Five art students and five business students.
 But P is different.
 Yeah, but it's okay.
 P is different, right?
 For individual students.
 Doesn't matter, right?
 You want the first art student use a MacBook,
 and the first business student use a MacBook, right?
 The problem can be different.
 The individual problem can be different.
 But when you combine together, you still need to...
 Fine.
 That's it.
 So we don't need to discuss.
 Okay.
 You don't have to do this kind of thing.
 Do you do this kind of thing?
 Completely.
 Something like this?
 But you know binomial, right?
 Yes.
 But this is basically binomial problem.
 You just don't need binomial distribution.
 Never mind.
 That's why you can't do that.
 But it's not very cost-effective.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Monday.
 That's what I was thinking.
 I didn't do it.
 No.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Let's do it.
 Let's do it.
 Let's do it.
 Let's do it.
 I saw what you're saying, even though it's different, right?
 But it's just the motion.
 It's different.
 So you say that already.
 That's a false.
 Even when you calculate, it is only one.
 One, one, one, one.
 No.
 One, one, one.
 Oh, yeah.
 But I already know that.
 How is that okay?
 Okay.
 At the beginning.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Control.
 Okay.
 No.
 No.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Well, what happened?
 What happened?
 Lower, right?
 What?
 Are we even
 separate these two, right?
 Are we two long?
 What's that?
 Where's the
 He has the
 He has the
 He has the
 Right
 Right
 Right
 A little bit off, but that's okay
 Okay
 First of all
 I recommend you find the
 The
 The log-line function
 The log-line function, right?
 Because taking the algebra
 I usually
 I usually
 But
 I don't think so
 This is not right
 The last two, right? It's one minus
 The last one, is it one minus, right?
 Is this a tossable function?
 Okay
 You want to show me your work?
 You may end up with a quadratic function at the end, okay?
 You want to solve the quadratic function? Here's a formula.
 Say ax squared plus bx plus c is zero, x will be negative b plus or minus square root of b squared plus 4ac over 2a.
 Do you mean this equation to solve for zero?
 Yeah, that's very well.
 Maybe you should work your way up to your quadratic function.
 Okay, let's check it out.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 Probably you need that.
 Because it's not able to solve alphabetically, right?
 Okay, so listen to what I'm saying.
 Do you want to go home?
 Yeah, okay, you keep going.
 But we haven't done yet.
 So you can work on the LFR.
 Finish this one.
 The other one, problem three, right?
 But on the price tag.
 The reason is there's a total of four pages.
 I'll give you the first two pages.
 You can do something in class.
 This is the sign I'll do next Friday.
 Let's see.
 Let's see.
 All right, now at six, 10, right?
 Show me what you got.
 You need to get the exact answer, okay?
 You need to get the exact answer.
 But you have to be on the right track, okay?
 What did you say?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Okay.
 This should be the derivative of a log income.
 You should put a five here.
 Five, right?
 Yeah, put a five here.
 That is the derivative, right?
 Okay, type your name.
 Last one?
 Yeah.
 All right, good job.
 Present.
 Okay, now what's the name?
 Okay, five.
 Good job.
 You got the right equation.
 I agree.
 But you need to double your algebra, right?
 You should get a quadratic function.
 And use that equation to get the value of Q.
 All right?
 You need to get the right number.
 Okay, get on the right track.
 Yeah, is your name right?
 What's your name?
 Okay.
 Next person.
 Do you like this chapter?
 Do you like this chapter?
 Okay, good.
 You're welcome.
 That's the derivative.
 You should see here, right?
 This is the derivative of the function, right?
 At least I know what you're talking about, right?
 Okay, okay, type your name.
 Okay, type your name.
 Okay.
 Five.
 Good job.
 Good job.
 And just run the project.
 Okay, of course.
